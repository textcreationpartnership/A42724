            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

In all which time (untill Nature gave place unto extreme age and infirmitie) if my abilitie aſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with induſtrie hath advanced thoſe, that were commended to my inſtitution, in manners, and learning; I deſire that they may render and attribute the ſole thankes unto you.

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen in the yeere 1601 I gave out a little treatiſe concerning the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of perſons in the Vnitie of the Deity, for ſuch reaſons as appeare therein, I made a conditionall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of a further aſſertion of every Article of our Chriſtian faith. This promiſe of mine hath oftentimes ſince that beene exacted both by friends, and ſtrangers. That treatiſe tryed the common fortune of all bookes; ſome ſlighted it, becauſe it brought nothing but that which was common, others condemned it, as thinking it unfit that matiers of faith ſhould be perſwaded by reaſon. They of the firſt ſort were not onely mine acquaintance, who might commend my Booke for affection to me, but ſome ſtrangers, who for their liking of the booke became after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards my friends. And theſe encouraged me to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of my promiſe. The ſecond ſort did not a little comfort me, becauſe I had in no ſort troubled the peace of the Church. The third ſort have held me diſheartned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till now: for although I there ſhewed, that even in matiers where faith is moſt required, both our Lord and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
<pb facs="tcp:107656:4"/>perſwaded by common reaſons, as alſo the Prophets before-time had done: yet though I knew no reaſon of their diſlike, I did forbeare, becauſe I would not offend of ignorance. But ſeeing the everlaſting ſaving or loſſe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the ſoule, is a thing which of all other concernes a man moſt to thinke of; and that all ſorts and ſects of men, which farre exceed us Chriſtians in multitude, <hi>See Brere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woods enquirie of Religion Chap.</hi> 14. have hope of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall life aſwell as wee, it concernes us not a little to ſee wherein our advantage is, and what aſſurance wee have more than they. Now to let paſſe the falſe Religion of the <hi>Paynim</hi> idolaters in <hi>Lapland,</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> and that great continent of the <hi>South;</hi> what is our preheminence over the <hi>Iewes, Turkes</hi> and <hi>Heretickes</hi> of the former times? of them that are, and ſtill will be untill the time that all things ſhall be reſtored? The <hi>Iewes</hi> hold firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as we, the authoritie of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> and denie the <hi>New.</hi> The <hi>Turkes</hi> alſo, though they ſpeake honourably of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as of more than a <hi>Prophet:</hi> yet of the holy Scriptures which wee receive, they make little reckoning; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they reade the <hi>Pſalter Azoa</hi> 7. yet they ſet up their <hi>Alcoran</hi> as their Idole which they worſhip. Doe not the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>Tertullian contra Marcionem,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine de Haereſ. Cap.</hi> (<hi>See</hi> alſo the epiſtle of <hi>Orig.</hi> cited by <hi>Iohn Picus Miran. pag.</hi> 206.) witneſſe how the authoritie of Scriptures was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed by the <hi>Heretickes?</hi> ſome they rejected, the reſt they corrupted by falſe interpretations, by adding, and taking away what was for their purpoſe. It ſeemes therefore, that the authorities on all ſides reſpectively being of like regard, the maine advantage which we have, is in reaſon, as it ſhall hereafter appeare, in every Article of our Faith. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they that denie us the uſe of reaſon in a matier of ſo great importance as our Religion is, bereaue us of our chiefe advantage; and (as much as in them is) turne us out of the fold of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to chuſe at large what Religion we like beſt. But if man were created in the image of God that hee might know and ſerve him as he ought, and if common reaſon rightly guided be that image of God in us yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining,
<pb facs="tcp:107656:4"/>as it is plaine, becauſe that image and wiſdome of the Father is that light which lightens every man that comes into the world, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. I ſee no cauſe why reaſon, that eſpeciall and principall gift of God to mankinde, ſhould not be ſerviceable to the principall and eſpeciall end for which man himſelfe is created, that is, his drawing neere unto God by faith in him: for the excellencie of every thing is in the excellencie of the End for which it is. And that common ſence and reaſon have their eſpeciall uſe in things pertaining unto God, it is moſt manifeſt. For all our knowledge proceeds from meere ignorance, firſt knowing words, by their meaning, then things by fence and experiments, from whence the reaſon aſcending by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirie into the cauſes comes at laſt into the knowledge thereof, and ſo unto the chiefeſt and firſt cauſe, wherein alone it findes reſt. And ſeeing man alone of all the viſible creatures is framed and formed of God unto this ſearch, by the outward ſence and reaſon to finde the wiſdome and power of God in the creature, that ſo honouring him therefore as he ought he might be made happie thereby: if it bee no way poſſible by reaſon and diſcourſe to come to this end, then ſhould God want of his honour by ſome of thoſe meanes by which it might be given unto him, then ſhould the creature bee failing to man in the ſpeciall uſe, which he ſhould make thereof to God, then ſhould reaſon the chiefe facultie of our ſoule, and principall meanes of our knowledge, have beene given unto man in value; that is, as ſence is to the beaſts, onely for this life; if it were either no helpe at all, or an unfit, or an inſufficient meane to know that which is moſt neceſſary and worthy to bee knowne; and yet obſcure, to ſtirre up our induſtrie, that as faithfull ſervants we may improve thoſe gifts wherewith God hath intruſted us: <hi>See Luke</hi> 19.1. And ſo the purpoſe of God ſhould be fruſtrate, both in the inferiour creature, and in man, and that in their chiefeſt and uttermoſt end. <hi>See Prov.</hi> 16.4. But theſe things are impoſſible, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee are commanded <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.5. to love and ſerve the Lord our God with all our heart, the ſeat of reaſon: 1 <hi>King.</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:107656:5"/>3.12. with all our ſoule, the ſeat of the will and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in heavenly things, and all our affections, there ſtiled by a word of vehemencie or exceſſe. And thus doe we ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the counſell of the wiſe <hi>Pro.</hi> 3.9. to honour the Lord with all our ſubſtance, that is, whatſoever is ours without or within, as ſence, reaſon, underſtanding, affections, and will. But ſtill you ſay that reaſon is an unſufficient meane, and unable to bring us to the knowledge of thoſe things which we are bound to beleeve: for elſe the <hi>Heathen</hi> which know not the Scriptures, might have known the truth of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as well as we. <hi>Anſ.</hi> There be divers kinds of queſtions about every ſubject, <hi>as I ſhewed Log Chap.</hi> 3. Now the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion or Article of our faith by the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> or <hi>Infidell</hi> or weake Beleever being made a queſtion, the reaſons brought are to prove onely that the concluſion is true, not alwayes why it is true: for there be many concluſions in our faith which cannot be knowne and proved <hi>prioriſticè</hi> (as they ſpeake) that is, by their immediate and neceſſarie cauſes, ſeene and underſtood in the effects neceſſarily following thereon: for then that humilitie which ought to be joyned with our faith, ſhould bee without reward; but yet the foundation of our faith is ſure, becauſe the Spirit of God which underſtands the things which are of God, hath revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Scriptures whatſoever is neceſſary for us to know or beleeve concerning God: &amp; thus <hi>poſterioriſticè</hi> or by way of induction are all the Articles of our faith approved by reaſon: ſo that our faith and hope are not of things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, but ſuch as are true and neceſſarie to be. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, if there bee but one God, one Lord of all, one faith, the onelie way to come unto God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.6. as it is plaine there is but one Mediatour, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. without whom none can come to the Father. <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.6. It cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, but that the ſame glorious faith which we are taught in the holy Scriptures of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament</hi> (excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting onely the hiſtoricall circumſtances thereof, as names and times, as that the Mediatour <hi>Ieſus</hi> was to bee borne of a Virgine, <hi>Mary,</hi> and to ſuffer death under <hi>Pontius Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, &amp;c.</hi>) muſt be that very ſame faith by which all the
<pb facs="tcp:107656:5"/>Saints of God were ſaved for above two hundred and fifty yeers before there were any Scriptures written. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that although this faith was delivered and reverently embraced by the faithfull before the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who alſo ſo delivered it, as that they could not looke unto the end of the law, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.13. Yet they who either received it not by tradition, as moſt of the Gentiles, or underſtood it not in the Law, as few among the Iewes did, beſide the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, muſt of neceſſity through the light of reaſon alone hold with us ſome maine and fundamentall points, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which, if they lived in obedience, they might finde mercy, for that whereof they were ignorant, as it is ſaid <hi>Act.</hi> 17.30. that God overſaw or neglected the ignorance of the time before Chriſt. For if the repreſentative Prieſt, by forein bloud found forgiveneſſe for himſelfe and the ignorances of the people concerning all puniſhment in this life: how much more might the everlaſting high-prieſt by his owne offering of himſelfe finde eternall redemption for their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norances, who ſought mercy of God, although they knew him not by whom they did obtaine it? yet might they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore aſſure themſelves to obtaine it, becauſe they could not ſeek forgiveneſſe but by his Spirit who framed their hearts to ſeeke it, and therby gave them an earneſt or pledge that they ſhould finde it. Compare herewith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.18.20. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.6. Now thoſe maine points, of which I ſpake, which by the light of reaſon they might know, are theſe. Firſt, that there is a God infinite in goodneſſe, in glory, in wiſdome, in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as it is manifeſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19, 20. and elſewhere: Secondly, that this God the maker of all things, according to that goodnes, made every thing to an end infinitly good, as farre as the creature could bee capable thereof: And that therefore the happineſſe of man could not bee in this life, ſhort and miſerable, but that his hope muſt bee for hereafter. And therefore thirdly, that hee muſt needs perſwade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe that hee was immortall, and that there was an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall life, at leaſt as appertaining to his ſoule. Fourthly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a mans wretchedneſſe is for the moſt part from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, in the unlawfulneſſe of his owne ill deeds, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb facs="tcp:107656:6"/>from the bitter fountaine of his affections, and ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires tormenting himſelfe: therefore hee muſt needes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe his ſinne againſt himſelfe, and know that hee that finds himſelfe ſo diſpleaſing to himſelfe, can no way hope, that for his owne worthineſſe hee can any way bee acceptable unto God: and that therefore he hath no ſuccour nor hope, but only in his mercy that hath made him thereunto, if he will, deſire, and truſt in his mercy. And thus far the reaſons of the heathens, and the Religion of the Turkes doe drive them. But here that fooliſh Religion of the Turkes is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſtay, not holding it neceſſary to beleeve a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: becauſe (ſay they) God infinite in mercy made his Creature onely, becauſe heloved it. Thus while they truely magnifie the mercy of God, they utterly forget that hee is Iuſt. Vnto which infinite Iuſtice of God if they had taken due regard, the ſame light of reaſon would further have ſhewed unto them, that the ſoule that ſinnes muſt beare a puniſhment anſwerable to his ſinne: And becauſe by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſinne againſt God an infinite Iuſtice is offended; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is impoſſible that any man by his owne righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe (which can never bee any more than by the Law of God he is bound unto) ſhould bee able to make any ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for his ſinne. Vpon which true principle it will follow neceſſarily in the light of reaſon, either that there is no poſſible returne to the favour of God: which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion a man would by all meanes avoid; or elſe that the reconciliation of mankinde unto God muſt needs bee by the mediation of a man in every reſpect free from Sinne, who bearing the puniſhment due to ſinners, might finde redemption and mercy for all them that would beleeve it, and live worthy thereof. But becauſe all men conceived in luſt and ſinne are originally tainted therewith; for out of uncleanneſſe who can bring that which is cleane? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt the generation of this Mediator bee wonderfull and not after the common manner of all men; but ſo that no ſinne or taint of the fleſh muſt bee therein. So that being both borne and living, without ſinne, hee might by his death become a ranſome acceptable for the ſinnes of
<pb facs="tcp:107656:6"/>others. And although reaſon could not conceive nor finde how this ſhould bee; yet ſeeing that in the neceſſitie of the divine juſtice it muſt bee thus; reaſon would as eaſilie yeeld that it might bee, as it did finde and ſee the creation of mankinde and the whole creature out of nothing, as by the diſcourſe enſuing it will hereafter appeare. If this were not thus, how ſhould the whole world of Infidels and misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers bee liable to the juſtice of God for their ignorance of him, for their neglect, and for their unbeliefe? So ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it as granted, till it doth further appeare by the Treatiſe following, that reaſon hath right good and neceſſarie uſe in the things of faith; it is too manifeſt, that theſe wretched times are ſuch as ſeeme to call aloud for the publiſhing of ſome ſuch worke as this: for though the fooles, that have ſaid in their hearts, there is no God, dare not in words profes it; yet by their continuance in their ſinful deeds they do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime that their thoughts are ſo. Neither are they altogether wanting which ſay, that Religion is but a politicke inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to keep men in civill obedience: but if the concluſions of the Chriſtian Religion bee inferred upon neceſſarie princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, then are they not made out of policie, as theſe Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts ſay, but cannot prove it, except they could alſo make it appeare that policie was able to make naturall reaſon. I will not denie that <hi>Mahumed</hi> ſetled his religion ſo, as they ſay; but hee forbids to diſpute of the principles thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is againſt both reaſon and Scripture; and ſo perhaps it may bee ſaid of thoſe Will-worſhips that are, or have beene among other Gentiles, to whom God vouchſafed not the knowledge of his Law. But our moſt holy faith becauſe it alone is true, hath no other author than God himſelfe, who hath revealed it by his word: and becauſe no man ſhall bee excuſed if hee beleeve it not, hee hath commanded reaſon, whereof all men are partakers, to ſeale thereto in everie point: but becauſe in the Treatiſe before mentioned, and by the whole practice of this booke this thing is manifeſt, I will here turne mee onely to anſwer thoſe doubts which may bee brought againſt the
<pb facs="tcp:107656:7"/>perſwading of matiers of faith by humane reaſon. Firſt it may bee objected, that the matiers of faith are farre above humane reaſon, and that therefore it is a great preſumption to queſtion or skan them thereby: for it is ſaid by S. <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 11.33. that his wayes and wiſdome are paſt finding out. I confeſſe, we know nothing of God, but what he hath revealed of himſelfe by his workes, or by his words, for hee dwelleth in the light that none can approach unto, even as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes there of his calling and election to faith, a will unrevealed: but the Articles of our faith hee hath moſt plainely taught and revealed. And further to the argument, I confeſſe that humane reaſon turning it ſelfe to behold the divine truthes, is as the eye of a Bat to looke on the Sunne. But yet the eternall and infinite truthes are ſo apprehended by mans finite underſtanding, as the light of the Sunne is by the eye, that is verely and indeed the ſame light, and no other: for though the eye cannot receive all the light of the Sunne; yet that which it doth receive is truly that ſame light which is in or from the Sunne. But you ſay, that if in things of common uſe, as hony, ſalt, or any other things vegetable or minerall, wee muſt confeſſe our exceeding ignorance of their nature, properties and poſſibilities, both alone, and much more in all manner of compoſitions; it may ſeeme that our dulneſſe may much rather be acknowledged in things divine. I yeeld not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to this conſequence: for to the knowledge of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall things, we have our owne witleſſe experience to helpe us, and the deceitfull authoritie of miſtaking men: but all thoſe truthes whereon our faith relies, are grounded on the infallible rules of Gods owne word revealed by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe unto us, for this end, that we ſhould not bee deceived or miſtaken. And although it was impoſſible for humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ever to finde out the concluſions and moſt fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall points of our faith, as the myſterie of the Trinitie, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation of God, the reſurrection of the body, &amp;c. yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the cleer light of Gods own word made known unto us, we approve the ſame truth by the judgement and voice
<pb facs="tcp:107656:7"/>of reaſon. So the reaſons that are brought hereunto are not to eſtabliſh any truth new or unheard of, but for that faith which was heretofore taught &amp; delivered unto the Saints; &amp; if the reaſons of themſelves be weak, and by their weakenes ſhew how mans underſtanding is dazled at the divine light; yet the concluſions ſtand ſure and unmoveable: but if the reaſons bee certaine and true; then queſtionleſſe they are grounded in the Word and truth of God, and the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on true, either for the reaſon delivered, or for a higher rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which wee cannot finde. To this purpoſe the Father <hi>Anſelm. de Conc. Gratiae &amp; lib. arbit.</hi> ſaith not unfitlie, <hi>Sacra Scriptura, omnis veritatis quam ratio colligit, authoritatem continet, cùm illam aut apertè continet, aut nullatenus negat. Quod enim apertâ ratione colligitur, &amp; illi ex nullâ parte Scripturae contradicitur quoniam ipſa ſicut nulli adverſatur veritati, itae nulli favet falſitati, hoc ipſo quiae non negat, ejus auctoritate ſuſcipitur.</hi> Yet you will ſay, that this endeavour is altogether needleſſe, ſeeing the concluſion of it ſelfe is more manifeſt than the reaſon. I anſwer; The eye is not ſatisfied with ſeeing, nor the underſtanding with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: and if the eye bee not able to behold the beames of the Sunne, either direct from it ſelfe, or reflected in a loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king glaſſe; yet it joyes to ſee that ſhining lampe when his beames are refract, or as it were broken off; as in water, a thin cloud, or a coloured glaſſe: ſo mans underſtanding not able to underſtand the glorious light of Gods holie truth ſhining from himſelfe, for that is his garment; nor yet reflected on it by his word, a word, like the ſpeaker, of infinite wiſdome; yet takes it infinite delight to ſee, if it be but a glimps of that cleere light, thorow the thick cloud of humane reaſon, thorow which being refracted, it is better fitted to be looked upon: for becauſe reaſon and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is more naturall to the ſoule of man, than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, and becauſe the ſoule as every other thing, joyes in the naturall abilities of it ſelfe, therefore though the reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſoule doe beleeve what it is taught by the ſpirit of <hi>Chriſt</hi> inſtructing it; yet if that bleſſed Spirit vouchſafe further to
<pb facs="tcp:107656:8"/>enable the naturall abilities, that it may ſee the reaſons of the leſſons taught, it triumphs much more therein: for faith is a ſupplie of reaſon in things underſtandable, as the imagination is of ſight in things that are viſible: now as the imagination takes the ſhapes, proportions, and diſtances of perſons and places by their deſcription, til it be better ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the very ſight of the things themſelves; ſo the ſoule through faith embraceth the truth of that which is taught, and relies on the ſtedfaſtneſſe of that which is promiſed, and this in full aſſurance and hope without wavering. Yet becauſe the things beleeved are of ſo great importance, it is glad of the helpe of reaſon whereon to ſtay it ſelfe; as a weak man though upheld in his going by one that is ſtrong and able to beare him, yet will not forgoe his ſtaffe, which without further aide could not ſupport him. Secondly, it is objected, that many learned men hold it not fit to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the things of faith by humane reaſon. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The 19. <hi>Serm. of Athanaſius</hi> cleerely refutes this opinion by many arguments. And I have knowne ſome able Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, as they have judged their hearers fit thereto, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade even the chiefeſt points of our faith by common reaſon. And are not the <hi>Bereans</hi> praiſed <hi>Acts</hi> 17.10. becauſe they examined the things delivered of <hi>Paul</hi> by the Scriptures? And is not reaſon the Scripture of God, which hee hath written in every mans heart? yet I examine not theſe things of faith, whether they bee true or no, as the <hi>Bereans</hi> did; but knowing, acknowledging, and to death holding them true, I bring all the ſtrength of my underſtanding to approve them ſo. And although it be not lawfull for mee to handle either ſword or ſpeare; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I wiſh well to theſe holy wars, I have as a ſtragler brought my baskets of ſtones, whence the cunning ſlin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers our <hi>Davids</hi> (if they pleaſe) may chuſe what they like, if any uncircumciſed Philiſtim, ſhall defie the hoſte of Iſrael. And thereto they want neither reaſon nor example. For no man makes due account of the Holy Scripture, whoſe heart God hath not touched, and ſo is already won.
<pb facs="tcp:107656:8"/>But there is none ſo brutiſh, which doth not willingly hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to reaſon. And did S. <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> or elſewhere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Idolaters, perſwade the worſhip of the true God, and Chriſt the Saviour of the world by the authority of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or by common reaſon, and their owne poets? beſide <hi>Aratus</hi> whoſe words he cites, you ſhall finde that his ſpeech is in their owne phraſe and ſtile, and much of the matier in <hi>Plato,</hi> and in ſpeciall his <hi>Phaedon,</hi> of the ſoules immortality. Did the valiant champions or Martyrs of Chriſt defend the Chriſtian Religion before <hi>Ethnick</hi> Emperours, by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Scriptures? Did the perſecutor <hi>Diocleſian</hi> give any credit to the holy text, when hee commanded it to bee burnt? Did not the <hi>Apoſtata,</hi> nicknamed <hi>Idolianus,</hi> therefore forbid the Chriſtians to inſtruct their Children in Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, Logicke and other liberall arts, becauſe they woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Heathens with their owne weapons? becauſe they defended their owne Religion, and ſhewed the madneſſe of Idolatry, by common reaſon? The bookes of <hi>Iuſtine</hi> the Martyr, of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> of <hi>Arnobius,</hi> and other are yet extant: doe they defend the Chriſtian Religion by Scripture, or rather by reaſon? by the innocent life of the Chriſtians; and the infinite good which the Heathens themſelves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by them. Who blames the later writers, I meane the Schoolemen, <hi>Aquinas,</hi> both the <hi>Raimunds,</hi> and the reſt? if their reaſons be good, allow them, if ill, amend them. What man of learning, praiſes not the endevour of the learned <hi>Mornay</hi> concerning the trueneſſe of the Chriſtian Religion? The Lutherans, I confeſſe, though learned, doe not every where like of this learning, becauſe it ſtrangles their conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation even in the birth. The Papiſts doubtles as learned as they, yet in this point are much more temperate. For though their tranſubſtantiation cannot ſtand with naturall reaſon, yet they doe not therefore thruſt the uſe of naturall reaſon out of Religion, but confeſſe Tranſubſtantiation to be a thing miraculous and tranſcendent. Therefore let theſe declaimers and froward oppoſers againſt reaſon vaniſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in their owne opinion; becauſe it is knowne by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
<pb facs="tcp:107656:9"/>that none are ſo forward to thruſt new doctrine and rules of life upon the Church by their owne authority, as they that gaineſay both reaſon and authority. Other cavils like to theſe you may ſee anſwered note (<hi>a</hi>) on <hi>chap.</hi> 11. where for further ſatisfaction, the manner of our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing is plainely declared. Thirdly, it will bee objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my ſelfe in particular, that ſeeing other men have handled divinity by common reaſon before, my paines herein might well have beene ſpared; And ſo much the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe that I, neither a Prophet, nor the ſonne of a Prophet, might (if any ſupply at leaſt had beene needfull to their former paines) full well have let this burden alone, too heavy for my ſhoulders, for them to take up who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing profeſt to divinity, might better have borne it. Vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to heare: For I heartily profeſſe that this taske had beene fitter for them to undertake, who had both more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and leaſure than I to performe it. But if either they thought not hereon, or held it not fit, or that their paines were otherwiſe imployed; their greater and more profitable labours deſerve more prayſes. And though I have ſtood all day in the market, becauſe no man hath hired mee; yet ſeeing I would as faine have the penny as he that hath borne the burden and heat of the day, I would not bee idle. But becauſe the knowledge and ſtudy of heavenly things, and the meanes whereby the ſoule may bee ſaved, concernes all men alike, even <hi>Amos</hi> among the herdmen of <hi>Tekoa,</hi> aſmuch as <hi>Azariah</hi> the Prieſt in the Temple of Ieruſalem; And that every one as he hath received, ſo is hee bound to make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his talent; Therefore although the burden I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, was more fit for a man in the ſtrength of his memory and underſtanding and too heavy for mee now waſted in ſeventy yeares, with age, ſickneſſe; and continuall paines; yet I truſted in him that directed my heart to take it up, that hee would give mee ſtrength in ſome ſort to beare it. But, concerning thoſe men that have laboured herein before me, although I praiſe their paines, yet I thinke them not fit for every mans uſe. <hi>Aquinas</hi> according to the greatneſſe
<pb facs="tcp:107656:9"/>of his active underſtanding in his bookes againſt the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, hath moved an endleſſe number of queſtions, of which (as it ſeemes to mee) many are very needleſſe and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to this my purpoſe, and would draw an Engliſh Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der into a maze out of which hee could hardly winde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. <hi>Raimund de Sabunde</hi> though his writings be eaſie and quicke, yet his matiers are ſcattered, and not according to that method which I intend. <hi>Savanarola</hi> wanders up and downe, meanes well, ſaith ſomething out of <hi>Thomas;</hi> but in his <hi>Triumphus Crucis,</hi> as in all the Schoolemen, and ſo in both the former, very many things are left out, which moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily belong to this our purpoſe, and many things brought in, which are not here at all queſtioned. <hi>Mornay</hi> though he deſerves much praiſe for his great reading, and his plaine and eaſie ſtile; yet beſide that which hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades concerning ſome few queſtions here moved, hee referres us to the Scriptures for proofe of the reſt. A moſt certaine proofe indeed, and above all other with a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an: but my purpoſe is to adde an overplus of proofe to the perſwaſion which the Chriſtian hath; and to juſtifie his faith againſt all adverſaries, not by authority of Scripture onely, which with Heretickes, Turkes, and Infidels is of ſmall regard. Moreover that which he perſwades, is by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in a manner altogether inductive: which kinde of proofe, although it bee more uſuall in the Scriptures than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other, and is of force ſufficient with them that hold the principles and maine grounds of Religion, for whom only they were written, and not for them who are without, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. yet, with infidels or adverſaries inductive arguments are of ſmall force, except they be layd downe with their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition as I call it, <hi>log. cap.</hi> 14. For other wiſe the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hath no foundation wheron it may ſtay it ſelfe. And he that in matiers of faith brings in reaſons which are not of force to compell the underſtanding to yeeld to the truth, gives occaſion to infidels and Atheiſts to ſcoffe at Religion, and leaves the wavering minded more unſetled than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: As I knew a young Scholar, who reading <hi>Euphues,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:107656:10"/>refuting his Atheiſt by ſuch flight inductions and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, onely probable, became much perplexed in his minde, till it pleaſed God by his light to ſettle his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. The reaſons of <hi>Raimund Lully</hi> and his manner of arguing gives more full ſatisfaction; And hee it is from whoſe enlightned Spirit I borrowed moſt, becauſe hee one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the reſt hath written particularly to almoſt all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Creed: yet that treatiſe hath great need, both to be cleered, and of ſupply. And although for examples ſake in his art generall, and inventive, hee handle ſome of the queſtions; yet while he ſtrives therein to ſhew the uſe of his art, rather than the truth of the things, hee propoſeth his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons with great confuſion, and exceeding difficulty to bee underſtood, as it will eaſily appeare to him that reades him. But to yeeld that, I tooke my light from thoſe illuminate doctors <hi>Aquinas</hi> and <hi>Lully</hi> (for I ſeeke not mine owne praiſe, but the manifeſtation of the truth of God and the joy and comfort of the Chriſtian ſoules among mine owne nation) was the light theirs? is not reaſon the common light of every man which can either finde it out; or ſee it being found? is the light in a Church his light that made the windowes thorow which it ſhines? what intereſt hath he therein more than any ſtranger that injoyes the light, yet knowes not the maſon? But if my knowledge of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that is my reading of <hi>Aquinas,</hi> make the reaſons his, then his reading of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſhall make the reaſons <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,</hi> from whom hee hath gathered his reaſons, ſome where whole and entire, every where from his principles. And ſo if my reaſons gathered from the practiſe of <hi>Raimunds</hi> art, or from his owne practiſe, bee therefore <hi>Raimunds</hi> reaſons, becauſe he delivered that excellent art, then the light ſhall be the Maſons. But if they for their goodly buildings, made Bay windowes to let in much light: And I for my low, yet ſure built houſe have made but caſements and loopeholes, yet ſo diſpoſed them as they may let in light enough to ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten every corner of my little roomes; Let everie one that is pleaſed come in and enjoy the benefit of the light, and
<pb facs="tcp:107656:10"/>thereby behold the truth of God, and rejoyce in His light; And when hee underſtands the reaſons; let him account them his owne, either to ſtrengthen himſelfe and others thereby againſt misbeleefe and doubting; or eſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch as ſhall either wilfully or ignorantly withſtand the truth. And if I for my long and great ſtudy earne not ſo much as the name of a diligent tranſlator, or an Abridger, or a gatherer hereby; yet if any man gather either profit or content, I ſhall be glad, for the paines that I tooke herein, brought unto me an abundant reward. And having thus defended my ſelfe I will tell you, for what reaſons I have at laſt taken heart, to diſcharge my ſelfe of my former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. Firſt of all, when in the earneſt thought of theſe things, I found that the holy religion of the Chriſtians, howſoever tryed by Scriptures or by the cleere evidence of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, had ſuch light and manifeſtation of the truth therein, as that all the darkeneſſe of hell could not dimme it. I confeſſe I had ſuch aſſurance of joy therein, that I jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged I ought not to conceale it alone. For what greater joy can any man have in all the miſeries and diſcontents of this wretched life, than to know and ſee; that his hopes propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for a better life are ſuch as cannot faile? then to ſee the exceeding mercy of God ſuch, as that hee requires nothing to bee beleeved for which hee doth not abundantly ſatisfie the underſtanding, if it will enlarge it ſelfe, and deſire to be ſatisfied. Is it nothing that the mouthes of all Hereticks are ſtopt hereby? I meane not every difference in opinion to be an hereſie, no not in an Article of Faith; but there is not any hereſie in any maine point, but by the ſtrength of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon alone, it may be overthrowne, as it will hereafter at large appeare. Beſides when the Chriſtian Religion is found to be ſo reaſonable, and to ſtand on ſuch ſure<note n="*" place="margin">Fundamenta ejus in montibus Sanctitatis. <hi>i.</hi> Scripturae ſacrae, et ratter is. Pſal <hi>87.1.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:107656:11"/>Heathens and misbeleevers, that, will they nill they, if they will bee men, and ſtand to reaſon, they muſt confeſſe that the Chriſtian religion is onely true. And ſeeing the world hath beene called to the marriage of the Kings Son, <hi>Luc.</hi> 14.16, &amp;c. Firſt by the voyce of nature, declaring the wiſdome and power of God in the creature, and that they that were ſo called would not come, becauſe their mindes were ſet on earthly things. Secondly by the Law: but the Iew who ſought righteouſneſſe by the Law, would try what his five yoke of oxen, that is, his keeping of the Ceremoniall Law, contained in the five bookes of <hi>Moſes</hi> could doe, and ſo would be excuſed. Thirdly by the Goſpell; but the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Goſpeller and falſe Chriſtian could not come, becauſe he is marryed to pleaſure, and worldly luſts; what remaines but that they who are yet ſtrangers, and walke in the broad wayes of ſinne and the by-paths of their owne inventions, ſhould by reaſon, that ſervant of God bee compelled to come in? And ſeeing the time cannot bee farre off, that all the nations of the earth are to bee called to the knowledge of Chriſt; For great ſhall his name be from the riſing of the Sunne to the going downe of the ſame, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.3. What hinders that the truth of Chriſt bee taught according to common reaſon, whereto every man doth liſten? For it cannot bee but that all Idolatry and falſe worſhip, all here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and diſſentions about Religion muſt then ceaſe, when the truth is taught in the evidence of that Spirit whereby e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man is guided. For as God made man reaſonable, ſo doth hee command nothing to bee done which in true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is not the beſt: nor require any thing to bee beleeved, which in true reaſon is not moſt true. You will ſay, is there no difference then betweene faith and reaſon? yes, very great. For Reaſon is buſied in the proofe of ſome generall concluſion which is to bee held for a truth, and ſo received of every man; but faith is the application of that concluſion to a mans owne ſelfe. As if it be concluded, that becauſe Chriſt being ſo conceived and ſo borne had no ſin, and therefore he ſuffered not death for himſelfe, but to ſave
<pb facs="tcp:107656:11"/>them that ſhould beleeve on him: faith applies this generall concluſion thus: but I doe beleeve, and therefore I ſhall be ſaved. Now this application is not made by reaſon, but by the ſpeciall inſtruction of the Spirit of God in the heart of the beleever, although it were inferred upon ſuch a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as was proved by reaſon. I have not endevoured herein to heap up arguments by numbers, but by weight, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have Ilet. paſſe all reaſons from forrein autority, and all that were but likely onely, and of ſmall importance, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have I brought any one, but ſuch as ſeemed to mee ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient of it ſelfe to confirme the queſtion. The reaſons here uſed are for the moſt part from the goodneſſe, power, wiſdome, and other dignities of God; becauſe the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are concerning the things of God, and no arguments can be of greater force, and more immediate, then ſuch as are drawne from the verie being or immediate properties of the things in queſtion, they are handled by neceſſities, and impoſſibilities, to ſhew that all things that are, and are not, ſtand for the truth of the promiſes of God to us, that by all meanes wee might have ſtrong hope and comfort in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And though I ſometimes bring one argument for divers concluſions, yet it is not therefore of leſſe force, no more than a good toole is of leſſe worth becauſe it ſerves for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers uſes. I have ſtudied for plainenes as much as I may; and therfore have I ſometimes handled the ſame reaſon both af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatively and negatively, that he that cannot take it with one hand, might hold it with the other: &amp; for that purpoſe alſo are divers reaſons brought, though all ſatisfying (as I thinke) yet perhaps all of every one not equally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood: but he that underſtands all, may upon theſe grounds or the like, bring many other to the ſame purpoſe, and give glorie to that infinite mercy, which hath ſo fortified this glorious truth which hee hath bound us to beleeve, with ſuch walles, bulwarkes, ravelings and counterſcarpes of reaſon, that all the power of hell, all the batterye of <hi>Atheiſts, Turkes, Iewes</hi> and other adverſaries, ſhall never bee able to overcome it. And becauſe a little light is ſoone loſt, if di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed,
<pb facs="tcp:107656:12"/>as in the Starres called <hi>Nebuloſae,</hi> and thoſe of endleſſe number and diſtance in the milkie way; I have propoſed the reaſons together in as ſhort and few words as I can, that the light of the reaſon may more eaſilie appeare. For oftentimes while men deſire to enlarge themſelves, the reaſon vaniſhes into words. The autorities of the ſacred Text I bring as need is, that the Chriſtian may ſee whence the Article of faith in queſtion is taken, and whereon it is grounded, and that in the proofe thereof I bring no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doctrine than the holy Scripture doth reach. Let no man carrie my words or meaning awry: for although in this ſearch of cauſes and reaſons, other concluſions offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themſelves, yet I held it not meet to propoſe any other things than the holy Church of old thought fit to be held as ſufficient for the ſaving faith of Chriſtians, conteined in the Creed which is called the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> as being gathered from their writings, and that according to that order as it is therein delivered, yet with ſuch prefaces and notes, as the neceſſitie of the things did drive me unto, leaving thoſe other things to the higher ſpeculation of them, whom God ſhall vouchſafe to enlighten for their further progreſſe from faith to faith, from knowledge to knowledge, till all the holie Church come to bee partakers of thoſe things new and old, that are kept for her in ſtore, when ſhe ſhall come unto the fulneſſe of the meaſure of the age of Chriſt; that is the perfect knowledge of all thoſe things which our Lord in his time taught his Diſciples, who were not able then to beare them, till they had received the light of the holy Spirit from above. If any man learned bee pleaſed to read in this booke, let him forgive me the harſhneſſe of my ſpeech, being to teach the unlearned in Engliſh a language not taught that nicetie of words, whereby to expreſſe the difference of things, which I eaſilie hope he will doe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee knowes that the infinite differences of things do much exceed the ſharpneſſe of our underſtanding, and yet the ſubtiltie of mans underſtanding doth goe farre beyond the rudeneſſe and ſcarcitie of all words and ſpeech. The
<pb facs="tcp:107656:12"/>Treatiſe, whatſoever it is, with all humilitie and reverence I ſubmit unto the undefiled Spouſe of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> my deareſt mother, the Church of <hi>England:</hi> and if I have done any thing herein which is pleaſing to God, or uſefull to his Church, let the glorie bee given to him, by whoſe onelie mercie and favour I have beene enabled to performe it. But let his holie Church graciouſlie pardon whatſoever is herein amiſſe through my weakeneſſe, or errour: And if any thing bee offenſive; let it by her cenſure, be as if it had never beene written or thought of.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He principall virtue of mans ſoule is Reaſon, unto whoſe power the ſoule would have every thing ſubject, if it might; becauſe that is the Standard to trie the truth; in the knowledge where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of principally the ſoule is delighted But becauſe arguments alwayes appeare not, by the weight of which reaſon may try the truth; the ſoule is content to beleeve or unbeleeve ſuch things, as it cannot trie by reaſon; either for the credit of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, or for the deſire which it ſelfe hath, that they ſhould be ſo, or not ſo. The firſt degree then of the powers of the ſoule above reaſon is faith: but becauſe the ſoule is loth to bee deceived, therefore will it not alwayes come ſo farre as to beleeve, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit a thing, but is content to hold it in opinion: and yet upon a more ſleight view, to ſuppoſe ſomething to be, or not to be, true or falſe for a time: for a man may ſuppoſe that to be, of which he will not entertaine an opinion that it is, yea and have
<pb facs="tcp:107656:15"/>an opinion of that, which he doth not conſtantlie beleeve; yea and beleeve that for which he cannot give a ſound proofe that it is. So that faith, opinion, and ſuppoſition, are of larger com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe one than another, and all of greater circuit than reaſon. Yet becauſe the imagination that lovely <hi>Dalilah</hi> is ever ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to reaſon her <hi>Samſon,</hi> though never faithfull; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is nothing in any of theſe three, which the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion dares not be buſie with; therefore by the helpe of imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, reaſon enquires into the workes of all theſe, uſing thereto ſaying and gain-ſaying, likelyhood and unlikelyhood, and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on every ſide, till it come to a concluſion, in which it will reſt, at leaſt for a time. And as every minde or ſoule is more noble and excellent than another, (for there are many more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of excellencie in ſpirituall ſubſtances than there bee in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily) ſo doth it exerciſe it ſelfe in the moſt hard and excellent things. And to ſet all other matters aſide (for all other are farre beneath the knowledge of God, and the aſſurance of our faith in him, which is our preſent ſearch) let us ſee by what degrees we are come unto that taske which we have undertaken.</p>
                  <p>Religion is a band or tyall of the conſcience in things pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto God, in reſpect of the excellency of the reward to them that doe well, or of the puniſhment of them that doe ill: for there was never any religion true or falſe, but it was ſet in the ſervice of ſome God, whom the worſhippers beleeved to bee juſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding both good deeds and bad, and that not only in this life, but much more in another, where they perſwaded themſelves the ſoule was immortall, as one of their falſe prophets truely ſaid, <hi>Virtus recludit non meritis mori Coelum.—</hi> Seing then that religion (as every other thing that is reaſonably undertaken) proceeds from the knowledge of the End; and that all religion doth ſuppoſe an everlaſting happineſſe, or puniſhment to the ſoule in immortality (excepting only that of the peſtilentiall Sect of the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> who though they confeſſed God, yet thought that the promiſes and threatnings of the Law ſtretched no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to this life only, and therefore denied the reſurrection, the ſoules immortality, Angels, Devils) It might ſeeme that I, who enquire of religion according to the diſcourſe of reaſon, might hold it ſufficient to lay downe the reaſons of the poſitive
<pb facs="tcp:107656:15"/>Doctrine without any mention of hereſies or contrarie opinions, and that I ought firſt to enquire,<note n="*" place="margin">See Chap. <hi>39.</hi>
                     </note> whether there be any ſuch happineſſe at all, as is ſuppoſed in the life to come.<note n="*" place="margin">See Chap. <hi>40.</hi>
                     </note> Secondly, whether the ſoule be immortall, and ſo capable of eternall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe. Thirdly, whether the ſoule although immortall, doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine a ſeparate and an entyre being by it ſelfe, or whether when it departs out of the body, it doth not returne into the <hi>Chaos</hi> of life, as a drop of water falling into a river: for if any one of all theſe points faile; that is, if there be no happineſſe at all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death, or if the ſoule enjoy it not, becauſe it dyes, or if that happineſſe be not peculiar and entyre to the ſoule by it ſelfe, and in it ſelfe, then the end of all our religion is utterlie fruſtrate. But for the preſent, they ſhall be onely as <hi>poſtulata,</hi> or ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; the proofe ſhall appeare hereafter in the Article of <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life.</hi> And concerning hereſies, I confeſſe that in this diſputing age, wherein men will rather ſeeme to know, that they may oppoſe the truth, than willingly to ſubmit themſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, I had great doubt in my ſelfe, whether by the remembrance of them, I might not give occaſion to ſuch as itch after opinions, to be tainted with theſe ſtinking ulcers, or at leaſt cauſe a doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or falling away of them that are weake, when they conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the diverſities that have been, and ſtill are concerning re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. But when I remembred the ſaying of S. <hi>Paul 1 Cor. 11.19. There muſt be hereſies even among you, that they that are approved might be knowne:</hi> I ſuppoſed that this benefit would grow thereby, that men in the examination of opinions might be more firmely grounded in the truth of God, while they take heed to his word, as to a light that ſhines in a darke place. Therefore as Mariners ſet Buoyes and Seamarkes for avoyding of ſhipwracke; or as Phyſicians deſcribe <hi>Aconitum</hi> and other poyſonous herbs, that they may be avoyded, ſo are theſe hereſies here ſet out.</p>
                  <p>Moreover in this triumph of the truth of Chriſt, a great part of the captive traine ſhould have beene wanting, if they had not been driven before the triumphant Coach: Whereas now the Chriſtian may have comfort to ſee how the truth hath been fought againſt, but yet hath overcome; hath beene beſieged, not taken, battered, not ſhaken: ſo that hereafter he may contemne
<pb facs="tcp:107656:16"/>the force of any adverſarie. And for feare of danger, I thinke there is none; when both by Scripture and reaſon theſe hereſies mentioned are ſo utterly overthrowne. But if any contrary to both theſe will yet bee licking of that foule vomit, Let him that is filthie, bee filthie ſtill; and let him that is holy, be holy ſtill. The hereſies I mention under the moſt uſuall and knowne name, not reckoning up for oſtentation, all thoſe that were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of that opinion. The word <hi>Hereſie</hi> I uſe at large, for any opinion which a man doth chuſe to maintaine againſt the truth; knowne or unknowne. And herein I put not onely the perverſe opinions of them that have beene called Chriſtians, but alſo thoſe falſe poſitions of the Heathens, who profeſt Philoſophie, of whoſe traditions and falſe principles we are admoniſhed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware <hi>Col. 2.8.</hi> And theſe things being thus remembred, let us now with due reverence and regard firſt be aſſured, <hi>That God is,</hi> that we may know what that glorious truth is, which is the ground and rule of all truth, and the foundation of our moſt holy and Chriſtian religion: becauſe that this foundation being once laid, the ſpirituall building of our moſt glorious faith may on that firme Rocke be raiſed up in all the parts thereof perfect and entyre. And as we know that the author of all truth hath no need of our Lye, whereby to be juſtified: ſo where the truth is manifeſt, let us not ſhut our eyes againſt it; becauſe we know that it is the ſhine of his being upon our underſtanding; and that for this end, that our underſtanding and will being enlightned thereby, we may find the way to everlaſting happineſſe.</p>

                        <p>Therefore let the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> heare, and the foole that ſaith in his heart, <hi>There is no God:</hi> for certainely, <hi>There is a God.</hi> And although no word or ſpeech can bee uttered, of which it is confeſſed that it is true or falſe, but that it doth from thence follow neceſſarily <hi>That God is:</hi> yet I will take onely thoſe neereſt attributes, which we know to belong eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally unto him, and ſo affirme that by this name <hi>God</hi> is meant a being eternall, and infinite in all perfection of goodnes, wiſdome, power, will, truth, virtue, glory, and all thoſe excellencies which may be in ſo glorious and infinite a being. And againe convertibly, that this being moſt perfect in infinitie, eternitie, goodneſſe, wiſdome, glorie, &amp;c. is God. The firſt reaſon is from the eternity.</p>
                        <p>If there bee not a being which had no beginning, then that which was firſt exiſtent or begun, muſt bee a beginning unto it ſelfe, by cauſing it ſelfe to be when it was not. But it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that any thing ſhould be a cauſe, and not be: for ſo ſhould it both be, and not bee. Therefore there is an eternall being, the beginning of all things, himſelfe without beginning. And that eternall being is God.</p>

                        <p n="2">2. Seing there is being which could not poſſiblie raiſe it ſelfe out of not being; it followes, that being was before not being, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of neceſſitie muſt be eternall: for otherwiſe there was a <note place="margin">(a)</note>time wherein it might be ſaid, that being is not being, and ſo not being ſhould have been eternall, and <note place="margin">(b)</note>contradictories might have ſtood together; that is, not being in eternitie, and yet eternitie is moſt of all being. But theſe things are impoſſible: therefore there is an eternall being, and this eternall being we call God.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Eternitie is. For neither can Nature which in continuance tooke her beginning together with time: nor yet can mans under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding put any point of beginning in continuance, before which ſome other continuance may not be underſtood to be. Therefore all Nature and Reaſon muſt needs yeeld, that there is Eternitie. Therefore there is an eternall being: for if in eternitie you put pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or not being, it would be impoſſible that any thing ſhould be brought out thereby. Therefore God is.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Whatſoever enforces the privation, or taking away of a being infinitely and eternally good, brings in an infinite and eternall ill: But to deny that God is, enforces the privation or taking away of a being infinitely and eternally good: Therefore to denie that God is, brings in an infinite and eternall ill. Heare Atheiſt and conſider, how thou doeſt put ill to have the prioritie before good, both in being and in action: For that which is firſt, muſt needs be a cauſe to all things that follow; ſo that the cauſe of all things being ill (every effect neceſſarily anſwering the cauſe) every thing ſhould in the very being have beene ill: whereas ill is onely morall in the wickedneſſe of the qualities, or action, not of the being. [<hi>Gen.</hi> 1.31.]</p>
                        <p>The greateſt excellencie or perfection of every thing, is in the likeneſſe thereof unto the firſt cauſe: but every thing is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in the being thereof, than in the not being: therefore in the being it is moſt like the firſt cauſe; whereupon it followes that the firſt cauſe of all, is moſt of all being: therefore before not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſo eternall. And that is God.</p>
                        <p>All truths inferior and created, depend neceſſarily upon a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior and increated truth: for nothing can be in the effect, which is not firſt in the power of the cauſe. Wherefore ſeeing no ſpace can bee given ſo great, but that it is poſſible for the underſtanding, a created being, truly to conceive a ſpace yet more large: nor any number ſo multiplied, but that ſtill a greater number than it may be given; the underſtanding muſt needs yeeld, that there is a being infinite in extenſion, that fils all ſpace, and yet is infinitely greater than it: and a wiſdome or mind numbring, which is alſo infinite, which no number can-either exceed or equall, but only that moſt ſimple unity of his owne moſt pure and abſolute perfection. <note place="margin">(c)</note>Therefore there is a God.</p>

Yet if any ſuch there be, as <hi>Diagoras</hi> of <hi>Melos,</hi> and <hi>Theodorus</hi> of <hi>Cyrene</hi> were ſaid to be: they ſhall be reckoned the principall hereticks againſt this concluſion. <hi>Protagoras</hi> alſo ſhall goe in that number, becauſe he made it doubtfull whether there were Gods or no; whom the <hi>Athenians</hi> did therefore baniſh, and burnt his bookes. The ſecond ſort is of <hi>Paynims</hi> and <hi>Idolaters;</hi> who in ſtead of the true God worſhip falſe gods, Idoles and devils <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.12. The third ſort of <hi>Atheiſts</hi> are they, who although they denie not God in their words, and being overcome in their conſciences cannot denie him: yet in their actions and affections have no remembrance and regard of him. Theſe have the ſentence of their judgement already pronounced upon them <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.17. For whoſoever prefers any thing before God and his feare; either honour, riches, pleaſure, the favour of men, or whatſoever elſe; they ſet vp other gods, and ſo forſake the true God, and his Religion, which had not power over their conſciences to bind them to his feare. For he, that comes to God muſt beleeve that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that ſeeke him <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. A fourth errour is of them, who make the idoles of the heathens to be the ſame with the true God, knowne and worſhipped among the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> bleſſed therein above all people, becauſe <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ow is it poſſible to define or bound an infinite Being? If we looke upon the Creature to find a name for him thereby, though Hee bee the cauſe of all, though all things ſpeake his praiſe; yet Hee for ever dwelt in Eternity, before any thing in the Creature was. If wee looke upon the excellencies of the Creature, the goodneſſe, or wiſdome, or power, or glory, or virtue, or whatſoever elſe our words or thoughts can reach unto; yet all theſe excellencies are from him, the footſteps onely of his paſſage by them. The whole Creature therefore with all the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies thereof cannot afford him a name, whereby to know what his Being is: So wonderfull is He, ſo ſuperexcellent above all names. Yet ſuch is his mercy, as that in his holy word, he hath been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to liſp with us, as a mother with her infant, and to give us names as certaine remembrances whereby our hearts may be lifted up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Of theſe, ſome are given onely by way of compariſon, of which you may reade more in the 8. Chap. Some are onely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, by which we may better underſtand what he is not, than what he is, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Vnto the King Everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, Immortall, Inviſible, the onely wiſe God be honour and glory for ever and ever, Amen.</hi> Other attributes we give unto God, which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie perfections ſupereminently; as that he is the Chiefeſt good, the firſt beginning, the prime and principall perfection, and ſuch like; which although by the force of reaſon we are compelled to give vnto God: yet becauſe theſe generall expreſſions are too farre from our experimentall knowledge, we attribute unto Him, better, and more fitly thoſe perfections for which we have example in his word; wherof there be certain likeneſſes and experiments in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible creature; which becauſe it is his workemanſhip, we know there can be nothing therein, which is not ſupereminently in him that is the cauſe: as goodneſſe, wiſdome, vertue and ſuch like; wherein af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſort we are his image. Now among theſe, there can be none like that deſcription which God doth make of himſelfe <hi>Exo.</hi> 34.6, 7. where, of fifteene attributes which God doth take to himſelfe, the firſt three ſhew to us his eternitie, his infinitie, and his omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie, one his truth, eight (according to the number of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings <hi>Matth</hi> 5.) are all of mercy; three onely concerne his juſtice. And all theſe things follow neceſſarily one upon another.</p>
                        <p>For if God be without beginning (as was ſhewed before)
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107656:19"/>
                           <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. <hi>Re.</hi> 1.2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it muſt needs be, that he be alſo without ending: becauſe, He can have nothing before him, and ſo can have no ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour which might bring him to nothing. Therefore God is eternall, both before, and after; as they ſpeake, <hi>à parte ante, &amp; à parte poſt.</hi> Now eternitie is an infinite continuance, therefore whatſoever is eternall, is alſo infinite. Moreover whatſoever hath infinite continuance, hath an infinite <hi rend="sup">a</hi> power to continue infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely. Therefore God is Almighty, and of endleſſe power. By this therefore that God is everlaſting, infinite and almighty, we may very well conclude, that this glorious Being is moſt worthy to be God; ſeeing nothing can be before or after him, being eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, nothing greater than he, nor yet equall unto him, ſeeing he is infinite; neither all things, nor nothing able to reſiſt him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is Almightie. If God then be moſt worthy to be God, it is neceſſarie that he be moſt wiſe, moſt good, moſt true, moſt mercifull, moſt juſt, and moſt glorious. For otherwiſe he were neither worthy, nor yet poſſibly could he be God, if any thing might be more wiſe, good, true, mercifull, juſt, or glorious than He. Therefore God is wiſe, and wiſdome it ſelfe, good, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe it ſelfe, true, mercifull, juſt and glorious, truth, mercie, juſtice, and glorie it ſelfe. Neither can he move, or be moved from place to place; who fills all, and is infinite beyond all places: Neither can he be ſubject to any accident, whoſe being is moſt ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and pure perfection. And this is our God, thus deſcribed, as farre as the dimme ſight of our underſtanding is able to deſcry him. But that the truth of all theſe things may better appeare; ſeeing we now lay the ground of thoſe proofes which muſt follow here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: you ſhall for every one of theſe, or as many as is needfull, have a reaſon or two, and firſt.</p>
                        <div type="section">
                           <head>That God is Eternall or Everlaſting.</head>
                           <p n="1">1 IF God be not eternall, then it followes that he was brought forth from not being, into being: but it is impoſſible that God ſhould be brought forth from not being into being: for not being cannot be a cauſe: or if he were brought forth from not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by another that was before him; then ſhould that other bee more worthy to be God. But this is confeſſed, that nothing can either be, or yet be conceived to be more worthy than God. Therefore God is, and was for ever that which he is: and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hath been for ever, hath power to continue for ever: for otherwiſe the act of being ſhould be without the power of being (that is to ſay, a thing might be when it were not poſſible to be) but that is impoſſible. Therefore God is everlaſting, and can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have beginning nor ending.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Whatſoever is being, and once was not, muſt of neceſſitie bring on the being of ſome cauſe which brought it to that being
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:107656:19"/>which it hath: for nothing which onely may be, can come into perfect and actuall being, but by ſuch a powerfull being, as is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready actuall. Therefore there is either one firſt and chiefe being, the cauſe of all things, which is of it ſelfe actually perfect, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull eternally; or elſe nothing at all is, or elſe there is a ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of cauſes infinitely. The former of theſe two is falſe and againſt ſence: for I am, and thou art; the latter is impoſſible: therefore the firſt is <hi rend="sup">b</hi> neceſſarily true. Now the falſhood of this later appeares in this; for if there be a ſubordination of cauſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely, then ſeeing every effect is brought to perfection in a finite time, it muſt follow that <hi rend="sup">c</hi> infinite cauſes may worke in a time finite, and ſo infinite may be in that which is limited and finite. But this is impoſſible; therefore there cannot be a ſubordination of cauſes infinitely. Moreover ſeeing every effect doth naturally anſwer the cauſe thereof, and ſeeing the effects are of ſo different kinds, it muſt follow, that there is not onely an infinite ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of cauſes; but alſo that there be infinite ſubordinations of cauſes of kinds infinitely different, according to the different ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects brought forth. But this is impoſſible: for the cauſes being ordained for the effect, and the effect being the end of thoſe cauſes, that which is finite ſhould be more noble and excellent than that which is infinite. Thirdly if there be a ſubordination of cauſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely, of which one is moved orderly by another, it muſt needs follow that there is no moving, and conſequently no cauſing at all: for every cauſe being moued by that which is before or above it, if there be no firſt cauſe given, there can be no moving. But it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that in infinitie of cauſes there can be no firſt nor laſt, and ſo there ſhould be no moving, nor no immediate cauſe of the effect. Therefore there is one cauſe of all, whith is infinite and eternall.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 If God be not eternall, then either the world was a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning unto it ſelfe, or elſe it was eternally, and ſo ſhall continue eternally. But neither was the world a beginning unto it ſelfe, as is proved <hi>Cap.</hi> 1 <hi>Re.</hi> 1. neither is the world eternall, as ſhall be proved <hi>Cap.</hi> 13. Therefore God is eternall.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. And this truth of Gods everlaſting being, the holy Scripture teacheth every where, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.33. <hi>And Abraham called on the name of the everlaſting God.

                           <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Nfinitie cannot here be meant of multitude: for the more that multitude is increaſed in any kind, the more the dignities of one are abated. Neither yet can this infinitie be of quantitie: for infinity cannot be in quantity, no more than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity can be in time. <hi rend="sup">a</hi> Neither is God a body, which onely is capable of quantity; yet is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity of extenſion denyed; in as much as he fils all places infinitely beyond all place, as the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeaks <hi>Chap.</hi> 40.12. <hi>That he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures the waters in his fiſt and the heavens in his ſpan.</hi> Neither is God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite privatively, in regard of any defect or want of being: becauſe he hath the complement of all perfections in himſelfe. But he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite negatively: becauſe there is no limit or bound to be ſet to his being, to his perfection, or ſuperabundance in goodneſſe, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, power, truth and glorie. The reaſons are theſe.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Whatſoever is ſuperſupreme, or higheſt in all degrees of perfection, muſt needs be infinite; becauſe there is nothing above it which may limit or reſtraine it. But ſuch is the being of God, above which it is confeſſed, that nothing can be thought more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent. Therefore God is infinite.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Being taken abſolutely; that is, ſimply by it ſelfe without any limitation, muſt needs be infinite: becauſe infinite things by infinite meanes may be partakers thereof. But ſuch is the being of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:107656:20"/>God, that is abſolute and ſimple: for neither is his being from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other as the cauſe thereof, ſeeing he is eternall; neither yet in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, as a forme in the matter: for ſo ſomething ſhould be more excellent than he; as every totall is more excellent than any part thereof: or as the accident in the ſubject; for ſo ſomething ſhould be before him, and alſo be more worthy than he, as every ſubject in regard of the accidents. Neither yet is he for any other as the end thereof: for as all things are from him and by him as the firſt cauſe; ſo are they for him, as for their firſt and chiefeſt end, and ſecondly for themſelves, to finde themſelves happy in him as farre as they are capable, as the Apoſtle concludes <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.36. <hi>Of him, through him, and for him are all things, to him be glory for ever, Amen.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God is infinite.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. If the being of God be not actually infinite, then ſhould it be inferiour to the poſſibilities of the creature: for mans underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding though actually finite, yet admits the poſſibility of an infinite actuall being, as was ſhewed in ſpace and in numbers. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>Re.</hi> 6. But it is impoſſible that the being of God ſhould be inferiour to thoſe poſſibilities which the creature can reaſonably give unto him: for ſo the activitie of the underſtanding ſhould be created in vaine, if there were no being actually infinite to be apprehended thereby. So alſo the effect, that is the underſtanding, ſhould be extended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the being of the cauſe, that is God, if it could conceiue any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of being, goodneſſe, wiſdome, &amp;c. greater than his. Therefore it is neceſſarie that God be infinite. You may ſee more Reaſons <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. and there alſo the ground of this diſcourſe.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hings in their being are the object of our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that we may know the truth of their being; and therein is the underſtanding per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected: But things, as farre as they are good are the object of our deſire; as farre as we finde the likeneſſe of our ſelves, or of ſomething in our ſelves therein. But good is of divers kindes; the firſt and loweſt kinde is conditionall or civill, as riches, honour, favour of great men, authority; which are good or ill, according as they are uſed. Secondly morall, as the vertues and abilities of the minde, and the fruits thereof. Thirdly naturall, which is in every thing: and that either eſſentially, in the perfection of the being whereto it is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined; which every thing deſires, as the proper good thereof: or ſpecifically, in reſpect of thoſe proper effects which proceed from the eſſentiall forme; inaſmuch as every good thing imparts the goodneſſe of it ſelfe as much as it may. But the goodneſſe of God comes not into accompt with theſe: for although for that loves ſake which he hath of goodneſſe, he were pleaſed to imprint certaine likeneſſes of himſelfe in the creature; yet this was not out of any need which he had of the creature, without which he was and is infinitely happy in himſelfe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.2. Therefore the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion onely manifeſted the goodneſſe of God, that the creature ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaſure thereof might be good, perfect, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in him, who is infinitely good in himſelfe, as is manifeſt by theſe reaſons.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It is proved <hi>Chap</hi> 2. that the being of God is infinite. Hence it followes thus. Whatſoever is equall to an infinite being, muſt of neceſſity be infinite. The goodneſſe of God is equall to his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite being: for otherwiſe his being ſhould be defective, and ill, if by his goodneſſe it ſhould not be wholly and infinitely good. And if in any thing his being were defective, then ſhould it not be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely diſtant from not being, and ſo his being ſhould not be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite: but all theſe things are impoſſible. Therefore the goodneſſe of God is infinite.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Being and Goodneſſe are termes convertible, inaſmuch as every thing deſires the perfection of it owne being, as the proper goodneſſe thereof. But it is neceſſarie that ſome thing be chiefe and ſuperexcellent in being, as the cauſe of all other beings; therefore alſo in goodneſſe; and this is moſt eminently true in God, that his goodneſſe is his being; becauſe it cannot be in him as a property proceeding from any forme, he being utterly free
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:107656:21"/>from any compoſition; nor yet by any ſuperaddition, or putting to of any thing vnto his being, he being the cauſe of all, and utterlie free from ſuffering any thing from without. Therefore God is infinitely and eſſentially good.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. In the order of things being, it is neceſſarie that ſomething be ſupereminent and chiefe, either good or ill, which muſt of neceſſity be that which is the firſt, and cauſe of all other things. Good is a poſitive being, and brings in perfection: Ill is onely pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative, and puts nothing in being. And ſeeing the excellencie of every effect is in the multitude of the likeneſſes thereof unto the cauſe, if the firſt cauſe thereof be not ſupereminently good, then that which is ill and privative, ſhall be more actuall, perfect, and excellent, than that which is good: and every thing the worſe it is, ſhall be more like unto it, and that which is worſt of all ſhall be moſt like unto it; and that which is moſt of all not being, to wit, that which is utterly impoſſible to be, moſt actuall and perfect: but theſe things are manifeſt contradictions and utterly impoſſible. Therefore God the firſt cauſe of all, is ſupereminently and infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie good.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Whatſoever hath all the perfections of being in it, muſt needs be infinitely good. But God hath all the perfections of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in himſelfe, as being the cauſe of all. Therefore God is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely good.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. And this is that goodneſſe which our Lord would not ſuffer to be given unto any other. <hi>There is none good but one, even God. Marke</hi> 10.18. But the repreſentation of this infinite goodneſſe is diverſly imparted, firſt without meaſure, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.34. <hi>To him that is the image of his being. Hebr.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Then to them who of his fulneſſe have received, even grace for grace, Iohn</hi> 1.16. Thirdly to every thing in the being thereof, as I ſpake before <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.31. And hereby you may ſee the force of that argument which our Saviour uſes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.11. <hi>If you then which are ill can give good gifts to your children; how much more ſhall your heavenly father give good things to them that aſke him?</hi> See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he is goodneſſe it ſelfe, and this goodneſſe of God is the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſo many Pſalmes: <hi>Praiſe ye the Lord, becauſe he is good; for his mercie endureth for ever.

                           <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Very thing naturally ſeekes the preſervation of it ſelfe in the being which it hath, as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and happineſſe of it ſelfe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore firſt avoids thoſe things that are contrary thereto, as you may ſee in a greene ſticke put into the fire, how the water ſhunnes the heate, as the greateſt enemy it hath. Secondly encreaſeth it ſelfe by thoſe things which it can make like, and turne into it ſelfe, as I have elſewhere ſhewed, how every ſeed encreaſeth by the earth and moiſture thereof, which cannot be but with a wehling out, or choice of things that are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneous, or of parts like thereto; and a refuſing of thoſe things that are heterogeneous, that is of unlike parts, or of another kinde. And over and above this, every thing doth ſpread it ſelfe in that goodneſſe which it hath, upon thoſe things that are capable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as it appeares in the effect of every medicine. And nothing of all theſe things can be done, but by a certaine degree of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall knowledge inbred in every thing; according to which it doth chuſe or avoid thoſe things which are within the compaſſe of that knowledge. And this is ſeene in every thing ſimple, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, in things elementall, minerall and vegetable. But in things wherein life is more manifeſt, by moving, which we call <hi>Animall,</hi> the fruits of knowledge and underſtanding appeare in farre greater differences of degrees, as you may finde betweene the oyſter, or the ſnaile, and the fox, the horſe, or the elephant; of which they write, he may bee taught to know letters. <hi>Plin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hiſt. nat. lib.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp; Aquin. contra Gent. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 57. what knowledge theſe things have of the Creator, it is not eaſie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine. <hi>See Plin. hiſt. lib.</hi> 8. <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. But certaine it is, that the whole creature hath a moſt earneſt deſire and hope to bee delivered from that corruption and change whereto it is ſubject, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.19. But that man, though knowing nothing at all, but by the helpe of things ſenſible, was created to know and honour the creator by, and for his knowledge, is moſt manifeſt: for otherwiſe the Creator ſhould loſe his honour, which he might, and conſequently ought to have, by the outward ſences, from things ſenſible. And this was the condemnation of the world, that thus knowing by the creature, they did not honour him accordingly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. Of how much ſorer puniſhment then ſhall the Iew, and yet much more the falſe Chriſtian be worthy of? who having not onely the dawning light in the creature, whereby to ſee the power, the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:107656:22"/>wiſdome, and goodneſſe of God; but alſo the cleere Sun-ſhine and uſe thereof in the Scriptures of the old Teſtament, and yet much more evidence and proofe of the ſame in <hi>Ieſus Chriſt;</hi> for neglect of that grace ſo freely offered? The Angels yet in more excellent manner, though with their differences and degrees of underſtanding, without either ſence or imagination, by the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſight or beholding of things, know the truth of their being, properties, and poſſibilities: or elſe yet in a ſuperexcellent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, beholding the Creator, know by him his admirable workemanſhip. But how much more wonderfull is his wiſdome, <hi>Who is made more excellent than the Angels? Hebr.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Whom God hath exalted and given him a name</hi> (and being alſo) <hi>above every name? Philip.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Who is the image of the inviſible God, the firſt begotten of every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? Coloſ.</hi> 1.15. And laſtlie, how ſuperabundantly infinite is that wiſdome, whoſe brightneſſe ſhines, firſt upon that image, and thence reflected upon the creatures, becomes that light which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens the Angels, <hi>and everyman that comes into the world? Iohn</hi> 1.9. And that this wiſdome of God is infinite, it is apparent, not one-lie by theſe degrees afore declared, but alſo by the reaſons following.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 Whatſoever is imperfect and yet ordained unto a degree of further perfection, muſt needs be from that which is perfect, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to bring it to that perfection, whereto it is ordeyned. But ſuch is the wiſdome and knowledge of man; both by his owne experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the preſent imperfection, and ſacred authority of our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hopes: <hi>For now we know in part: now wee ſee thorow a glaſſe darkely. But hereafter wee ſhall know as wee are knowne, perfectly.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9. <hi>to</hi> 12. Therefore the wiſdome of God is perfect and beſeeming himſelfe; that is infinite.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The apprehenſion of the truth of things, is the object and delight of the underſtanding; and infinite truth of an infinite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. Seing then, that the truth of things being is ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold; and the poſſibilities of truths, in the poſſibilities of all beings much more indefinite: and the Fountaine of all theſe truths infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite: <hi rend="sup">a</hi> if the wiſdome of God were not infinite, that it might bee anſwerable to all truths: then ſhould they bee in vaine, and the knowledge thereof wanting in Him, in whom, and from whom, all truth both created and increated is. But this is impoſſible. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the underſtanding of the Creature bee admitted to ſee the truths of things created; yea, and all the poſſibilities thereof that God may have his glory from the Creature which is due unto him; yet cannot all the wiſdome of all the Creature ſound the depth of that Sea, whence all theſe truths proceed, but that muſt bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood onely by that wiſdome, and glorified onely within that glory which is in himſelfe. Therefore it is neceſſary, that the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God be infinite.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. If the truth of Gods being bee infinite, then it is neceſſary
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:107656:23"/>that his wiſdome alſo be infinite; For otherwiſe he could not know the truth of his owne being, and ſo not deſire, nor will it; nor yet be happy and glorious in his owne being. But all this is impoſſible. But the truth of Gods being is infinite. For as all falſhood is in not being, and neceſſary falſhood in the impoſſibility of being; So all truth is grounded in being, <hi rend="sup">b</hi> neceſſary truth in actuall being, and poſſible truth in the poſſibility of being. And it is manifeſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>cap.</hi> 3. that the being of God is infinite. Therefore his Truth, and ſo neceſſarily his wiſdome is infinite.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 No perfection which is in any kinde of being, can be wanting unto God, which is the cauſe of all being, as it is manifeſt in this, that he is eternall and made all things. But if infinite wiſdome be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting unto him, a principall perfection is wanting. Therefore God is infinitely wiſe.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. And this Argument the Prophet uſes.

Heb. 4.13. And yet becauſe it is as certaine, that whatſoever is in God, is eſſentially Himſelfe; As it will be manifeſt, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9. And that the being of the Creature is no way neceſſary to His being, infinitely and abſolutely perfect without it: it will be neceſſary to enquire, how the multitude of things created can be in the wiſdome and knowledge of God. And becauſe it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to put this: that the underſtanding of God, is by the moſt excellent and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect way of knowing: therefore it cannot be either by infuſion from another: nor gotten by experience and practice; nor by diſcourſe; as all the knowledge of man is by ſome of theſe; nor yet by the view of the things in themſelves, or of the things in another; as is the knowledge of the Angels; but onely by the pure
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:107656:23"/>and ſimple ſight of His owne being; which although it be moſt ſimple, and one; yet it is the patterne and ſample of all things, that can either bee, or bee knowne. Becauſe that on his being and power alone, the being and poſſibilities of al things depend. Neither can any thing be, live, or underſtand; but that in one or moe of theſe it expreſſes his Image. So that he in that one ſimple working of his owne underſtanding and ſight of himſelfe, ſees at once, both himſelfe, and in himſelfe; the being and poſſibilities of all things beſide. For ſeeing his underſtanding is his being, <hi>chap.</hi> 8. if Hee did underſtand by any other meanes than by the ſight of his owne Being; then Hee ſhould have in himſelfe a Being and a Being: then there ſhould be a cauſe of underſtanding to him without himſelfe: So his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſhould be in poſſibilitie only, actuated, or brought to worke by an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward underſtandable object: So his underſtanding ſhould be accidentall to Him, as ours to us; and ſo it ſhould not be infinite. For nothing can be infinite which is in poſſibility of being: becauſe it hath not all thoſe perfections of being which it may poſſibly have. So then, God by the fight of his owne being, knowes all things being<note n="*" place="margin">See chap. <hi>9.</hi> num. <hi>6.</hi>
                              </note> or not being. And to know all things in their cauſe, and by their cauſe, is the excellencie or perfection of knowledge. For although the effect be not neceſſary to the being of the cauſe; yet is the firſt cauſe more eſſentiall to the effect, than all other ſucceeding cauſes whatſoever they are. And therefore it is ſaid. <hi>Act.</hi> 17.28. <hi>In him we live, move, and have our being.</hi> Seeing then that all effects are in the power of the cauſe; and that every thing which is in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, muſt be therein according to the manner of that being wherein it is. If God be underſtanding and wiſdome it ſelfe: they muſt be in Him underſtandably, and therefore be perfectly knowne by Him.</p>
                           <p>But (you ſay) If the creature bee knowne and ſeene by the infinite wiſdome; and if nothing can be in God, beſide His very being, <hi>chap.</hi> 9. then that knowledge of the Creature muſt bee in the very being of God, becauſe it is in Him. Then it is neceſſary that in the divine being there bee a manifold or divers being, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a different knowledge; one, that whereby Hee knowes himſelfe which will eaſily be yeelded to be eſſentiall, and his very being, ſee <hi>chap.</hi> 8. and another of the creature: which is it be eſſentiall, His eſſence muſt be divers. Becauſe the eſſence and being of the Creator, and of the creature are moſt different. If not eſſentiall, it muſt be accidentall to Him; and ſo His being ſhould not bee infinite, and in abſolute perfection of being, if capable of accidents.</p>
                           <p>I ſay, that if the divine wiſdome ſhould view the being of the creature in any other being beſide himſelfe, then the divine underſtanding, for as much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes the creature, ſhould be dependent on that, which muſt be inferiour and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Him. Therefore all this quarrell is, becauſe that which was firſt deluded, was either not underſtood, or not remembred. It was ſaid, that the knowledge of all things is in God moſt certainely, moſt particularly, and that not according to the being of things as they are; but according to all poſſibilities whereto they are ſubject. But as the being of the creature comes not unto it, but by Him: ſo this knowledge of the creature in God, comes not to Him, as raiſed or gathered from the things in their owne being (for ſo it ſhould be chancefull, as they had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be) But by that being which they have in Him, as in their cauſe. For God knowing his power anſwerable to all poſſibilities of being, and Himſelfe able thereby to worke according to the pleaſure of his owne will, according to that pleaſure, appointed of all cauſes to the bringing forth of things in their being. Therefore as the power of all cauſes is from Him, the firſt of cauſes; ſo that knowledge of His, is a creating knowledge and eſſentiall to Him. For becauſe He is the firſt of beings, it is neceſſary, and eſſentiall to him, not onely to be the beſt, moſt wiſe, powerfull, infinite, &amp;c. and yet the moſt ſimple, and pure of all beings, but alſo the cauſe of all beings that can come after Him. Therefore as the being, ſo the knowledge of the creature alſo is in God; that is, in the object of his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:107656:24"/>underſtanding, which is his word, ſeene by one infinite action of underſtanding: For by his owne abſolute perfection, doth Hee meaſure all the diſtances of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, as by one ſimple unity all the proportions in numbers are both made and meaſured. Neither doth it any way follow, that becauſe the beings of God and the creature are divers, therefore his knowledge of Himſelfe and the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould bee alſo different ſo farre, as to make a different eſſence or being in Him. For the underſtanding of man though one in it ſelfe, yet ſees and knowes the things that are moſt different and contrary. As a looking glaſſe may repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent all bodily ſhewes without any change in the being of it, either eſſentiall, or accidentall: Beſide, that being of the creature, which He beholdes, is no other than that being which it hath in Him increated, eternally, intellectually, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fally. And if our imagination, or thought, which takes hold of nothing but by the outward ſence, doth yet turne it ſelfe from the ſence, to view the ſame like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe though abſent, though long agoe beheld; and the underſtanding much more taking that likeneſſe from the imagination, and utterly withdrawing it from mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, doth frame to it ſelfe a patterne or likeneſſe of the common or univerſall being, under which all things of the ſame kinde are contayned, expreſſed in the definition: how much more ſhall the divine wiſdome know the being, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilities of all things? not by that being which is in them, derived and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, whereby the Angels know; but moſt perfectly by that being which all things have in Him, which is in dependent. Of which being of the Creature, you ſhall have further occaſion to conſider in the 13. <hi>chap.</hi> when wee ſhall ſpeake of the eternity of the world, and the originall being of the creature.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. This may ſeeme an anſwer (you ſay) for things that are being, if good, if worthy His knowledge. But ſeeing that every thing that is knowne is after ſome ſort in Him that doth know: it may ſeeme that the excellency of his being and underſtanding cannot ſuffer, that the knowledge of things that are vile, and baſe, or eſpecially, that are ill, ſhould be in Him. For ſeeing thoſe things that are baſe and ill, ſeeme altogether to bee in want and defect of perfection, if the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them be in God, and conſequently his eſſence, then his being ſhould be of things which are in defect, which cannot agree to Him that is the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of all being. Moreover, if the things that are knowne by Him be in Him, as in their cauſe; then muſt it follow neceſſarily, that if He know things that are ill, He ſhould alſo be the cauſe of ill; which can no way ſtand with the infinity of his goodneſſe.</p>
                           <p>I anſwer. Baſe or vile, and excellent are onely words of Compariſon; And if all things created were excellent alike, then could nothing at all bee excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. But becauſe it is neceſſary for the beauty of the whole frame of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that there bee difference of degrees in greater or leſſe excellencie; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are theſe things which have fewer degrees of perfection in them, called meane, or vile, though not truly and indeed ſuch. For there is nothing ſo meane or baſe, but as it is being, it is a proofe and image of His being who created it, and ſo though not of it ſelfe, yet in it ſelfe is exceeding good <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.31. And if the order of Nature be well marked, as we know that the whole Creature was brought out of not being, into the meaneſt and firſt degree of being, which was water, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.5. ſo all the excellency that is in the creature, is but by addition of one degree of perfection unto another, which perfections taken together, with their cauſe and originall, are in their many differences; firſt being, then life, after ſence; fourthly Reaſon, as in a man; Fifthly underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by the onely ſight of the being, as in the Angels: the ſixth is of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived power of the Mediatour, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.2. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.20.21.22. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2. that runnes into infinity; the ſeventh is Infinity it ſelfe, in the ſimplicity of ſelfe being, beyond which is nothing. But whether theſe perfections of the creature, come into it by addition, as I have ſpoken, or that it be ſo raiſed from
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:107656:24"/>nothing immediately into thoſe perfections which it hath: it is neceſſary that theſe differences of degrees be therein, that that <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.10. that manifold wiſdome of God may be manifeſt in the Creature. In which creature how perfect ſoever in it ſelfe, no degree can bee found ſo excellent, but that it muſt differ infinitely on the one ſide from the perfection of the Creator: not none ſo meane, but that on the other ſide it muſt differ infinitely from not being: I meane that not being which it had of it ſelfe and in it ſelfe, for in him it had an eternall being, being eternally foreſeene and appointed in him.</p>
                           <p>§. 3. But in things that are ill, you thinke this anſwer will not ſerve; For though you can bee content to thinke, that the glory of the divine wiſdome is nothing abated in the beholding of things, no not in their preſent being, how dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering ſoever in their degrees of perfection, as it is ſaid <hi>Pſal.</hi> 113.5. <hi>Who is like unto Iehova our God, that lifteth up Himſelfe high to ſit; that abaſeth Himſelfe low to ſee in the heavens and in the earth?</hi> no more then the luſtre and ſhine of the Sunne is more or leſſe cleere, whether it light upon the beautifull hill of Libanus or Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell; or the dirty land of Cabul: yet if he know alſo things that are ill; and that his knowledge be a cauſing or creating knowledge, it cannot bee avoyded, but that he muſt alſo be the cauſe of ill.</p>
                           <p>I anſwer. Ill is of three kindes; one naturall, whereby every thing is ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſome other thing contrary thereto, whereby it may be corrupted, for the deſtruction of that particular being, that ſome other thing may be raiſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, according to the poſſibilitie of the matter, and the manner of the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Hitherto we may bring poyſons and all thoſe things that we call hurtfull and ill, becauſe if they be not rightly uſed, they are harmefull to our kind, which are not ſimply ill, but onely accidentally; ſeeing that if they be rightly uſed, they may be helpefull to our nature: as it appeares in the trocisks of the vipers fleſh, and other medicines, as Phyſicke teaches. So theſe things of themſelves naturally good, may be ill; that is, good cauſes of ill effects: as riches, and authority, things civilly indifferent, may bee ill, if abuſed to pride, idleneſſe, and the oppreſſion of others.</p>
                           <p>The ſecond kinde of ill is that of puniſhment, which cannot juſtly be termed ill, if you conſider the uſe and benefit thereof, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath taught <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. from <hi>ver.</hi> 5. to <hi>ver.</hi> 12. For neither can wiſdome be in things civill, or morall; but with the judgement of good and bad: neither is that judgement in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning of good and ill ought worth, if the good be not praiſed and rewarded, and the ill puniſhed. So that without juſtice and mercie, in reward and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; neither wiſdome, nor goodneſſe can be either perfect or praiſed. Therefore this kinde of ill, becauſe it is juſt that the ill-doer ſhould beare the burden of his owne deſert, is no way ill, but onely in the ſmart of the guilty ſufferer deſerving it. So theſe two kindes of ill (onely ſo called for ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects) though in themſelves neceſſary, and therefore good; will eaſily bee acknowledged to be from God.</p>
                           <p>The maine queſtion therefore is onely about that ill of ills which is ſinne: for ſinne, both in regard of the effect, which is puniſhment, and in it ſelfe the deſerving cauſe thereof; and much more taking occaſion by the Law holy and good to worke death in the ſinner; muſt needs be exceedingly ſinfull, as it is concluded, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.11.13. And becauſe it is as certainely and neceſſarily true, that finne is finne, and ill is ill; as it is, that good is good: and that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth in every thing, is in the perfection of the underſtanding; it cannot bee, but that all ill and finne is perfectly knowne unto the infinite wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Moreover, whether ill be onely a privation, or taking away of that good which ought to bee in the creature; or whether it bee any thing of very being therein: it is neceſſarie that the infinite wiſdome know all manner of beings, both according to their perfections, and all their poſſibilities and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:107656:25"/>defects. But concerning the manner of this knowledge, the Doctors ſay, That becauſe the very being of ill (you remember what ill I ſpeake of) is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the privation of that goodneſſe which ought to be in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; it is knowne of God onely by the contrary goodneſſe, as by the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is to ſay, to be a defect or privation of goodneſſe. Neither is it any defect in the divine knowledge, to know that which is onely a defect by the contrarie perfection; ſeeing nothing can be knowne further then according to that being which it hath. And therefore they ſay further, See <hi>Thom. Aquin.</hi> and his <hi>Comment. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 71. and <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 4, 5, 6, <hi>&amp;c. contra Gentes.</hi> That ill, inaſmuch as it is ſuch, is in the number of things not being: and that of things not being, there can be no cauſe efficient, but deficient and privative onely. For every agent workes as farre forth as it is in actuall being, to bring forth ſomething into acte or perfection, and that to a good end; ſo that ill comes into effect by accident, beſide the purpoſe and intent of the doer. <hi>Ah</hi> bleſſed <hi>Origen!</hi> hath thy too much charity been blamed ſo long? who art ſaid (though unjuſtly, ſee the defence of <hi>Pamphilus</hi> for <hi>Origen,</hi> and <hi>Ioh. Picus Mirandula de Salute Origenis</hi>) to have taught, that all ſinners, yea, even the devill himſelfe ſhall be ſaved at the laſt; now thou art juſtified. Sinne is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it hath no cauſe of being, but comes in by chance, beſide the good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the worker: he anſweres more directly elſewhere, as you ſhall heare by and by. It is ſtrange that this Doctor, who ſticks every where ſo cloſe to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> ſhould here depart ſo farre from him, as to make privation in the number of things not being, whereas <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> rancks it in the order of begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings with matier and forme. In the meane while underſtand, things not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are either utterly not being, or not being ſuch. In the firſt kinde you may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the ſecond terme of contradiction, See <hi>Log. Chap.</hi> 9. <hi>nu.</hi> 15, 16. as not a ſtone, not wiſe. By the affirming of which no being at all is put to the ſubject, as to ſay, Thomas is not a ſtone. The not being ſuch, which they call <hi>Non ens tale,</hi> may hold all thoſe termes which we call privative. But privation may meane, at large, either the abſence onely of any forme not due to the ſubject; and thus it is in the number of things ſimply not being: for ſeeing the preſence of one forme ſhuts out all other formes unfit for that ſubject: (although all matier in the root of nature be ſubject indifferently to all formes ſucceſſively) the privation of other formes follow thereon neceſſarily. As the forme of iron in the matier of iron is a privation of the matter of gold, ſo a horſe naturally covered with haire is thereby deprived of a covering of feathers like a bird. But this privation is not in the number of things that are ill, ſeeing it is the law of nature that every thing be upright in that proper kinde in which it is. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly privation may ſignifie the taking away of that forme which was in the ſubject, as blindneſſe in the eye, which as it may be ſaid to be not being in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the taking away of the ſight; yet in reſpect of the cauſes whence it may proceed, it is in the number of things being, yet ill in both reſpects; that is, of the want of that which ought to be in nature; and the cauſe, being ſuch as ought not to be, and ſo of all other ſickneſſes. Thirdly privation may be in a ſubject in reſpect of the forme to which it hath not yet attained, as Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar or dreggs in the wine, by the ſpirit of ſalt may be hardned into a hard ſtone; and ſo the diſpoſitions to other diſeaſes before they ſhew themſelves. And this privation or want of forme, is in the number of cauſes: as drought is in a thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie man to make him drinke. Now ſinne muſt be one or both of theſe two laſt orders of privation, and not in any order of things not being abſolutely: for ſo, firſt it ſhould not be ill: for that which is not at all, is neither good nor ill. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly it would bring upon God the greateſt injuſtice that might be, to puniſh the creature for ſinne, if ſinne were utterly not being. And thirdly, if ſinne were not being, then our Lord ſhould have died without cauſe: but it is plaine
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:107656:25"/>that ſinne was the cauſe of his death, that thereby he might deſtroy death, and the power of the devill over vs, to which we were ſubject becauſe of ſinne: but that which is utterly not being, cannot be a cauſe. Fourthly, if ſinne bee not being, where is then the way which God doth weigh out to his anger, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.50. when he doth balance the puniſhment with the ſinne? Are all the puniſhments of ſinne, all the ſorrowes of this life, and death at laſt, both bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and eternall, nothing? for if they be any thing, they cannot be an anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable puniſhment to that which is nothing. So many commandements of God, ſo many threatnings by his Prophets, and Apoſtles, ſo many woes denounced by our Lord, ſo many ſacrifices and clenſings from all the temporary puniſhments, and at laſt the death of the Sonne of God himſelfe for the eternall remiſſion of ſinnes, and is ſinne not being? How much more true is it to ſay, that our righteouſneſſe (as farre forth as it is of our ſelves) is nothing; and to confeſſe with the Prophet, that it is like a ſoiled ragge? as S. <hi>Paul</hi> knew, that in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as a naturall man, dwelt nothing that was good, that hee had not power, no not to thinke a good thought, as our Saviour hath taught us, that without him we can doe nothing. And he that hath had experience of the combat, that hath ſo often been foyled in the bickering, muſt needs confeſſe the ſtrength of ſin, and cry out, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of death?</hi> I ſay not, as ſome hereticks heretofore, that ſinne is a ſubſtance either materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all or formall: or as the author of that booke which is intituled <hi>Ratio Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> that it came into mankinde by that poyſonous ſlaver which the Serpent put upon that apple which hee reached unto <hi>Eve;</hi> but yet I ſay that ſinne is ſomething, but the worſt of beings: It is that peſtilentiall contagion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the devill hath infected the maſſe of all mankind: it is that ſickneſſe of the whole man, of which he languiſheth unto death; but principally the ſickneſſe of the ſoule, whereto nevertheleſſe the body is alſo ſubject, in fulfilling the unorderly luſts both of it ſelfe, and of the minde: for one of theſe works upon another, both for good and bad. Therefore to anſwer, how God doth will that which is ill; it is not nor can be denyed, but that Gods puniſhments of all ſorts, being weighed with the ſinne are juſt, ſo one ſinne as it is the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of another, may ſtand with juſtice, and both ſinnes together in juſtice may bee puniſhed. When <hi>David</hi> was in plenty and eaſe at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and had forgotten him that had delivered him out of all his troubles; O treaſon of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity! his eies wandered in the beauty of <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> and led his heart to luſt: ſo ſin conceived, brought forth adultery, that murder: thus one ſinne was the puniſhment of another; which were altogether at laſt puniſhed to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry degree, in the treaſon and death of his ſonne <hi>Abſalom:</hi> So if you compare the ſinnes and degrees thereof in the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> you ſhall finde one ſinne the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of another, and all together at laſt balanced in their plagues; ſo that it is moſt truely obſerved by the Wiſe, <hi>Sap.</hi> 11.13. that wherein a man ſinneth, thereby he ſhall be puniſhed. Now it is a cleere caſe, that all the ſinne of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde proceeds from the corruption of his owne nature, after which wee are moſt juſtly ſuffered to wander; becauſe that knowing both the rottenneſſe of our owne hearts, and the puniſhment due to ſinne, yet we doe not ſtrive and and fight againſt our ſelves, to ſubdue thoſe wicked thoughts, from whence is the ſtreame of all our ſinne. Heere you will queſtion what ſtrength wee have to fight, and univerſall grace, and free will: but they are beſide this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe; whereby it is cleere, that all our fins being but iſſues of our owne corruption, againſt which we ſtrive not; it is juſt with God, both to puniſh our careleſneſſe, and neglect of his commandement, and our owne ſafety, with ſinne, and to leave us in that corruption, to be guided by him whom we chuſe to ſerve, having forſaken our true Lord and owner. But becauſe this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption is from our birth, and that we made not our ſelves ſuch; but that by
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:107656:26"/>the fault of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſinne and death reigne over all; the ſumme of the queſtion is knit up in that one ſinne of our firſt father, concerning whoſe fall wee are brought to this point. If God ſo foreſaw the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> that he will'd it; it was impoſſible but that he ſhould fall; it he will'd it not, it was impoſſible that he ſhould. To which doubt <hi>Thomas Aquinas in lib</hi> 1. <hi>Sen. Diſt.</hi> 46. <hi>q.</hi> 4. anſweres wittily and modeſtly: that although the propoſition be true and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, yet it is not neceſſary that the will ſhould be carried to either ſide of the contradiction. His reaſon (as I thinke) is, becauſe truth is not the object of the will, but of the underſtanding onely; and therefore he ſaith, that God doth permit ill onely; not becauſe it is ill; but becauſe of the annexes or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendances thereon; either precedent, as becauſe it is good that the creature ſhould have the power, whereby it may be enabled to doe ill, or not to doe ill: or conſequent, which is that good that is occaſioned by the ill. I reverence the judgement: but yet <hi>(Doctor)</hi> the queſtion is here concerning good and ill, the proper object of the will: and as the underſtanding cannot avoid it, but muſt conſent to a truth which it knowes; ſo neither can the will in that which it takes to be good or ill, but that it muſt chuſe one, and refuſe the other. For as the outward ſences cannot refuſe to be moved by their proper objects; as the eare to heare a ſound within a meet diſtance; no more can the inward faculties of the minde. Beſides, the queſtion is here of the will of God, an infinite will, and convertible with an infinite underſtanding: for in God there is not one being of his will, and another being of his underſtanding; as will appeare more large hereafter in the 8. and 9. <hi>Chap.</hi> Neither is the will of God as mans will, which may ſit ſtill while his underſtanding workes; but what he underſtands, he wills it alſo to be, or not to be; as his promiſes are not yea and nay, but in him, all is yea, and Amen. Therefore to let paſſe thoſe queſtions which are moved hereabout, concerning the freedome of <hi>Adams</hi> will; why God ſhould forbid that to <hi>Adam,</hi> wherein he ſaw that <hi>Adam</hi> would tranſgreſſe, and ſo make his eating to be ſinne: for where no law is, there is no fiune; and ſuch unneceſſary queſtions; I anſwer directly, that it is utterly impoſſible, but that God did foreſee the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> the taint of all mankinde thereby, all the ſins and all the puniſhments wherunto any one particular perſon is lyable, all the wandrings, backſlidings, and wants which can be in the creature. Neither will I bluſh to affirme with the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.32. That God hath ſhut up all under ſinne, that hee might have mercy upon all. But it followeth not hereupon that hee decreed our miſery in <hi>Adam;</hi> becauſe he foreſaw it: yet ſuch was his mercy, that out of this great evill, he wrought a greater good; ſo that it may ſeeme by conſequence we are rather gainers by <hi>Adams</hi> fall: for though we loſt by the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> an inheritance of holineſſe, &amp;c. Yet that holineſſe was like the morning dew, that vaniſhed at the heat of the firſt tentation; it was a created holineſſe, it was in a low degree; fit to his being in whom it was. Is not the preſent inheritance of our holineſſe more ſure, more excellent, who are made partakers of his holineſſe, who is holineſſe it ſelfe? his knowledge was but of worldly things, ours of eternall: and though our naturall knowledge bee by <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne corrupted, or loſt; yet ſhall it at laſt be reſtored againe with end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe advantage: for the gift is not as the ſinne. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.15. His life but a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall life; ſo that if <hi>Adam</hi> had not ſinned, he might have lived a naturall life till now, and afterward; free from fickneſſe, and want, abounding in all the knowledge of nature, and naturall bleſſings; but that ſhould have beene the end of his hope (as farre as I can ſee) though ſome there be that give us hopes of the ſame degrees of happineſſe and glory, which now we have, although <hi>Adam</hi> bad not ſinned. Yet becauſe they ſee that that could not be brought to paſſe, except God ſhould take our nature, that thereby we might be lifted up to that eſtate of glory; they thinke that <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord ſhould have come in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:107656:26"/>the place of <hi>Henoch,</hi> the ſeventh from <hi>Adam,</hi> and that therfore <hi>Henoch</hi> was taken away in ſtead of <hi>Chriſt. See Paſtellus de Nativitate Mediatoris pag.</hi> 116. But wee are bound both by reaſon and authoritie of holy Writ to know and confeſſe; that the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was of the earth earthly, and ſuch ſhould our happineſſe have beene, if we had continued in our created innocencie; the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> is the Lord from heaven, heavenly; into whoſe image being renewed, we are made partakers of his ſuperexcellent and heavenly glorie. The meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we come to this ſtate of glory is alſo our aſſurance that it ſhall be fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed. God dwells in our fleſh, O unſpeakeable myſterie! he hath taken upon himſelfe our ſinnes, O unſpeakeable love! he calls them his owne ſinnes. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.12. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. He hath healed us with his ſtripes, and is made unto us wiſdome, righteouſneſſe, holineſſe, redemption, life, with an over-aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding waight of glory. Is not the exchange well made with this advantage? who would not loſe himſelfe that he might winne Chriſt, with all his demerits? who would not forfeit the life and happineſſe of <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocencie, that he might gaine the life and glorie of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his eternitie? And thus much briefly for the advantage.</p>
                           <p>Is it nothing to ſee the infinitie of the wiſdome and goodneſſe of God, which out of the greateſt ill, could bring the greateſt good? The greateſt ill on <hi>Adams</hi> part was his ſinne, which from him ſpread it ſelfe over all mankind, to make it li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to eternall death: on the devils part his malice and murder; yea ſuch a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as could not be in the world beſide, in one man to murder the whole world of men. Is it nothing (I ſay) that out of this great ill, God could bring the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt good; that is, our aſſured and everlaſting righteouſneſſe and glorie? is it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that he hath caught the wylie in his owne craftineſſe? for whereas the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill envying that happy eſtate wherin man was created, ſought his overthrow by making him ſubject to ſinne, and ſo to death; He our Creator, to ſhew to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities and powers, the riches of his wiſdome, and goodneſſe in man; did not onely redeeme him from that thraldome of ſinne and death; but alſo exalted him unto an eſtate of glorie and happineſſe, farre above that in which he was created. Thus out of the eater comes meat, and out of the ſtrong comes ſweethes. <hi>Iud.</hi> 14.14. Thus the head of <hi>Leviathan</hi> is broken in pieces, and given to be meat to us in the wilderneſſe of this world <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.14. Therefore ſeeing it was the good will and pleaſure of Almighty God to mankinde, to make him partaker of theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable mercies, which his goodneſſe hath wrought unto us out of the ill of our ſin; and becauſe he that wills the end, wills alſo thoſe meanes that leade unto the end, we may with reverence to his wiſdome and truth affirme, that although God by his revealed will forbad the tree of knowledge unto <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo made his eating ſin, yet in his ſecret counſell he did foreſee that ſin in <hi>Adam,</hi> not as an enforcing or a working cauſe, but leaving him to himſelfe. But here a doubt muſt be anſwered; firſt, if we be indeed redeemed from the thraldome of ſin, why doth God ſuffer ſin ſtill to remaine in us, yea ſo far forth, as that we cannot ceaſe to ſin, yea ſo farre forth as that it makes our beſt actions, even our prayers abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, while our tongue utters one thing, and our heart wanders after another? <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It was poſſible and eaſie to God ſo to have renewed the heart of man, ſo as that he ſhould not ſin: but yet God would let ſin to dwell in us for divers ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to us; but eſpecially for two; firſt that at the fight of our ſin, we might caſt down our ſelves before him, and utterly renouncing our owne worthineſſe, we might ſeek that righteouſnes which is of him, and in him alone; the ſecond, that by the perpetuall remembrance of our ſin, &amp; the puniſhment due unto us for the ſame, we might be thankfull unto our moſt mercifull Redeemer, by faith the anker of our ſouls, holding out our hope, that although we fal, we ſhal not be caſt away: and hereupon depends our repentance, our patience, and our endeavour to the maſterdome of our owne wickednes. Thus as the wiſe Phyſician for long
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:107656:27"/>continuing and deepe rooted maladies, gives ſtrong purging medicines of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, or Colocynthis, and after applies his cordialls; ſo our moſt gracious Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, to let us know what we are of ourſelves, leſt through pride the ſinne of the rebellious Angels, we ſhould be loſt for ever, doth not only ſuffer us to taſte the bitter fruits of our owne corruption: but ſuffers ſinne alſo, as the fleſh of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomons tyre to be ſtill in us, that by it, the vertues of the precious ſpices of his graces may be conveyed to our hearts, to preſerve us from eternall death, that balefull infection of the devill, unto everlaſting life.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ight or power is of divers kindes; as you may reade <hi>log. appendix of Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>introduct.</hi> I will not ſtand repeating, nor in this queſtion make any mention of that power which they call paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, becauſe it meanes a power onely to ſuffer in things that are weake and imperfect. The might which I meane here is abſolute, perfect, infinite, which belongs to God, and to him alone, as it appeares by theſe reaſons.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. What power ſoever it is, which is equally powerfull over all being, either in acte, or in poſſibilitie of being, muſt needs bee infinite or almightie: but ſuch is the power of God; therefore God is Almightie. It was manifeſt before <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. that God was everlaſting, and ſo not by any other; but that all things either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or poſſible to be, are from him above, as it will further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. and upon this conſequence it will further follow neceſſarily, that God is Almighty, <hi rend="sup">a</hi> in reſpect of the creature.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi rend="sup">b</hi> If God bee not Almightie, then either that which is, or that which is not muſt bee able to reſiſt him: but neither that which is, nor that which is not, is able to withſtand him; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God is Almightie. The propoſition is plaine, that hee may doe what he will doe, who can finde no hinderance or let in his doing. The aſſumption alſo is as true: for the things that are, are all from him, as the fountaine of all being, as it is confeſſed by the voice of heaven, <hi>Reve. Cap.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Thou art worthie O Lord, to receive glory, and honour, and power: for thou haſt created all things; and for thy wills ſake, they are, and have beene created.</hi> And that the things that are not, ſhould be able to withſtand him is utterly impoſſible; for ſo, not being ſhould be more powerfull than being, and being
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:107656:27"/>more powerfull muſt of neceſſitie be; and ſo ſhould both be and not be, which is an abſolute contradition, and utterlie impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. Therefore the firſt, that God is Almightie, is true of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. If God be not Almighty, ſo that his power may be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to his other dignities in infinitie; then either his power muſt bee accidentall to him, or elſe his being muſt differ eſſentiallie from it ſelfe; but both theſe things are impoſſible: for in him is no accident, nor ſhadow of change, <hi>Ia.</hi> 1.17. as it ſhall appeare more at large <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. And for the ſecond conſequence, it is as plaine: for that which is infinite, and that which is finite muſt needs differ eſſentially, ſo that if his goodneſſe, his eternitie, wiſdome, &amp;c. being eſſentially himſelfe, as is ſhewed <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. be infinite, and his power likewiſe eſſentiall to him, and yet finite, then his being muſt needs differ eſſentially from his being. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is neceſſarie that God be Almighty.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Nothing can either be or worke; but by that power which it hath, both to be that which it is, and to doe that which it doth; ſo that if the power of God were not infinite or almightie, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could his being be everlaſting by his eternitie, neither could his inward action in himſelfe be infinite and eternall, neither could his goodneſſe, his greatneſſe, his truth, glory, &amp;c. be that which they are, neither by his wiſdome could he know himſelfe infinite and eternall, nor yet able to doe any thing anſwerable to his goodneſſe, truth, and glory, <hi>Reade Pſal.</hi> 111. Neither could he delight himſelfe and be ſo happy infinitely in his owne good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, greatneſſe and glory; and ſo he ſhould not be God. But all theſe things are impoſſible: therefore God is Almighty. And this the holy Scripture every where proclaimeth, firſt by the voice of God himſelfe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 35.11. <hi>I am God Almighty,</hi> and <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.3. <hi>I appeared unto Abraham, Iſaac, and Iacob, by the name of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God.</hi> Then by his Prophets, <hi>Iob</hi> 27.3. <hi>This is the portion of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants from the Almightie.</hi> This is alſo the voice of heaven <hi>Revel.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Holy holy Lord God Almighty, &amp; Revel.</hi> 15.3. <hi>Great and marvellous are thy workes, Lord God Almighty.</hi>

                              <hi>(a) IN reſpect of the Creature, Rea:</hi> 1.] The firſt argument is the effect of thoſe which <hi>Tho. Aquin.</hi> hath brought to this queſtion, in his ſecond booke, <hi>Cont. Gent. cap.</hi> 22. And although this infinite power bee one of the inward per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the being of God; no leſſe than His goodneſſe, eternity, infinity, &amp;c. which the Doctor ſaw well enough; yet becauſe hee could manifeſt it beſt by the effects in the Creation, therefore hee deferred it to that place. Yet by this meanes He left the queſtion proved but in the ſmalleſt part, becauſe the infinity of Gods power, though manifeſted in the Creation of a Million of worlds, of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:107656:28"/>which every one ſhould be greater and better than this; yet could they not way be an object anſwerable to his power, to which nothing can bee equall but only Himſelfe. Wherefore the Doctor was compelled to adde hereto two chapters, 23. &amp; 24. as certaine ſupplies. That God wrought not the Creature by any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, but according to the purpoſe of his owne will and wiſdome: yet would I not be thought to blame theſe or the like arguments, though in effect only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive. For the Holy Scripture, in infinite places uſes the like. And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe principally (as concerning the literall interpretation) are all thoſe reaſons and inſtances which are brought in <hi>Iob,</hi> from the beginning of the 37. chap. to the end of the 41.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>(b) If God be not Almighty, then either that which is, or that which is not,</hi> R. 2.] Many queſtions have beene moved, and ſtill are by idle and preſuming Wits, concerning the knowledge, will, and power of God. In the will and foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God is that great doubt, which is about predeſtination, and reprobation, wherein I have ſaid ſo much, note <hi>a</hi> in the 5. <hi>chap.</hi> as may direct the honeſt min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, who enquires thereinto, not for controverſies and diſputations, wherein the practice of godlineſſe doth not at all conſiſt. Concerning the power of God, ſome queſtions are moved, meerely captious and idle; ſome, though unneceſſarily, yet more pardonablie: but becauſe that in every thing which wee know truely of God, there is exceeding comfort; it is not unfit to heare ſome of them, and to give an anſwer. Firſt it is demanded; If God be Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and all knowing, whether he bee able to doe that, which he knowes to be impoſſible to be done. I anſwer, That onely ſuch things are utterlie impoſſible to be done, whereof there is neither power nor knowledge; neither doe they come into the account of things. But poſſibilitie and impoſſibilitie are not to be meaſured by us: for thought to man many things ſeeme impoſſible; yet to God all things are poſſible. <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.17. And this difference we our ſelves ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of our owne wits, or in our beſt wits acknowledge, when in ſuddaine or great dangers, out of which we ſee no poſſible avoydance, wee call upon God, as acknowledging our eſcape poſſible to him.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Whether God can call backe or undoe the things that have beene. <hi>Salomon Eccleſ.</hi> 1.9, 10. ſaith, <hi>That which hath beene, is that which ſhall bee, and there is no new thing under the Sunne. Is there any thing new? it hath beene already in the time that was before us.</hi> But whereas <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeakes by way of compariſon or likeneſſe; or that things paſt may bee figures and prophecies of things to come: I thinke you meane the ſame in number, and that in reſpect of their being onely; then I anſwer, No. For that which hath beene, is as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to have beene, as it is neceſſarie for that to be, which is. Now to be, and not to be, implies a contradiction, or a ſaying and gaineſaying of the ſame thing. And that any thing be, infolds neceſſarily the will and power of God thereto; ſo that any thing ſhould have beene, and not have beene, it muſt of neceſſitie enforce that God ſhould both will, and not will the ſame thing: but to will, and not to will proceeds from extreme weakeneſſe of foreſight, and want of judgement in the difference of things that are good and bad. But no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of weakeneſſe can belong to God; as to be leſſe then hee is, in any of his dignities, to ceaſe to be, or will that which is ill, to be inglorious, to forget, to ſuffer violence, to be weary, ſorrie, angrie, to denie himſelfe 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.13. as it is ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18. <hi>That by two immutable things,</hi> a promiſe and an oath, <hi>wherein it is impoſſible that God ſhould lie, we may have ſtrong conſolation; which lay holde on the hope which is ſet before us.</hi> Neither yet can that belong to God, which is againſt the neceſſitie of being: as becauſe the being of God muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie be independent, therefore God cannot make another God beſides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, which ſhall bee equall to himſelfe, and independent. Neither yet in things being, becauſe all his works are done in truth and judgement, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.7.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:107656:28"/>is it poſſible to change them, as that 2. and 3. ſhould not bee 5. that a tryangle ſhould not have three corners: and therefore thirdly, if it be queſtioned;</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Whether the ſame things which God hath wrought, were poſſible to be done otherwiſe than they are done? I anſwer, The power of God in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is conformable to his will; his will to his goodneſſe; his goodneſſe to his wiſdome. So as God in his wiſdome ſeeing what was good in the creature, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the pleaſure of His will, ſo framed the creature, as it is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 134.6. <hi>Whatſoever pleaſed the Lord, that did he in heaven, and in earth; in the ſea, and in all deepe places.</hi> Therefore ſuppoſing that it was His will, ſo to worke in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as he hath framed it, it was not poſſible to be done otherwiſe than it is. For ſo his will ſhould not be abſolute, and unchangeable; nor yet his will and power ſhould be convertible. But yet ſeeing the creature is no way a proportionable object to his wiſdome, and his power; if it had ſeemed good unto him, Hee might have done the ſame things otherwiſe then hee hath, in reſpect of any limitation which he found in the creature; And may create other worlds and beings, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from this, according as it ſhall ſeeme good to His infinite wiſdome. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the poſſibilities mentioned before, are in reſpect of the creature only; not in reſpect of the infinite power of the Creator, who by that which Hee hath wrought in the creature, hath put an impoſſibility to change or undoe that which He hath done.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hatſoever is equall to an infinite being, muſt of neceſſity be infinite. But the Will, the truth, the Glory of God, and all his other dignities, are equall to his infinite being. Therefore they are infinite. Concerning his Will, it is apparent, for every thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (in this repreſentation of God) doth naturally will or deſire the being of it ſelfe in all the perfections thereof. So <hi rend="sup">a</hi> God wils his owne being, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his being is infinitely good, powerfull, glorious &amp;c. And if hee did not will his owne being; He ſhould be againſt his will; and in that caſe be moſt miſerable, as being the chiefeſt of beings. And ſeeing He is the greateſt good that can be, if his will ſhould not Will ſuch a being, then were it defective and ill, if any way oppoſite to the chiefeſt good. But all theſe things are utterly impoſſible. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Will is infinite. And as theſe reaſons confirme the infinity of His Will in his owne being: So the Holy Scripture witneſſes the ab ſolute freedome of his will in the creature, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.3. <hi>Hee doth
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:107656:29"/>whatſoever Hee will,</hi> Iob. 23.13. <hi>He is one and who can turne him? what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever His minde deſires, He doth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. And concerning his Truth, it is alſo manifeſt. Truth is either reall, that is, in the being of the thing, which elſewhere, <hi>log. ſect.</hi> 3.9. I call metaphy ſicall, or intellectuall; that is, where the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding apprehends the thing according to the truth of the being: and if it conceive it otherwiſe than it is, then deceit or falſhood is in the underſtanding onely, or in the words the expreſſion of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, but not in the thing, as <hi>Agrippa</hi> makes it, <hi>Comment. in Artem brevem Lulli.</hi> The reall truth is that, whereby the thing is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that which it is, in what ſort of being ſoever it is. So that if the being of God bee infinite, as was proved <hi>cap.</hi> 3. then it is neceſſary, that his truth alſo bee infinite. And this is that which God ſaid of himſelfe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.14. <hi>I am that I am.</hi> ſpeaking of the truth of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite being. Or you may take it thus: Seeing every thing is that which it is, by the truth of the being, if the truth of God were not infinite, then could neither His being nor His goodneſſe, nor any of thoſe dignities which wee have before proved to bee infinite, be ſuch as they are proved to be, and ſo all the impoſſibilities ſhould of neceſſity follow. But theſe things cannot be ſo. Therefore it is moſt neceſſary that his truth be infinite. Secondly, ſeeing the truth of all underſtanding and of all ſpeech is founded in the truth of the being of things. If the truth of God were not infinite, and anſwerable to his being, but that his being were infinite, and his truth finite, the underſtanding could not be aſſured what to conceive truly of God, neither could we know what we might truly affirme or deny con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, and ſo our faith and hope in him ſhould never bee ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, neither could we bee aſſured of any truth, either in Religion or any thing elſe. For if certaine truth be not in Him, much leſſe in the things that are by Him; ſo that all truth ſhould ſtand onely in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and according to that idle fancie of the Scepticks. But this, as it is againſt all reverence we owe to God, ſo is it againſt all reaſon and ſenſe: and thoſe certaine truths that have hitherto beene proved. Therefore the Prophet <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.6. calles him the <hi>God of Truth,</hi> in as much as all truth, which can be in any underſtanding, or utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by any ſpeech, muſt be grounded in the being of things, and all being is onely in Him, and from Him. And therefore he ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.160. <hi>Truth is the beginning of his word.</hi> So Pſal. 100.5. <hi>His mercy is everlaſting, and his Truth from generation to generation.</hi> And Pſal. 107.2. <hi>The truth of the Lord endureth for ever.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. Happineſſe is imputed to every proſperous ſucceſſe in any mans undertaking, and that not onely in the laſt end of his Aymes, but likewiſe in all his meanes thereunto. Bleſſedneſſe is only in the laſt end which a man propoſeth, as the Covetous bleſſeth himſelfe in the multitude of his riches, the proud in his honour, and every Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious man, when hee can make his miſchievous imagination to proſper. But the Glory whereof I ſpeake, holds all that holy bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſednes
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:107656:29"/>or delight, which is in God by the ſuperexcellencie of his owne being; which if it bee not infinite, then muſt it be, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is a greaterneſſe in his being, and a leſſenes of His enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of himſelfe; which cannot ſtand with the action of His Infi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nitie, ſhewed, <hi>chap.</hi> 10. or becauſe he knows not his owne worthines, which ſtands not within his wiſdome, or for ſome defect or other which cannot ſtand with the poſſibility of his perfection, who hath in Himſelfe all things that hee can deſire. Therefore his glory is infinite.</p>
                        <p>Moreover if no perfection can come to Him from without, it muſt follow neceſſarily that he hath all poſſible perfections in Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. But it is plaine, that no perfection can come to him from without, who gave to all things their being and welfare. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his bleſſedneſſe or Glory is infinite; As it is ſaid <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.1. <hi>O Lord my God thou art exceeding glorious; thou art clothed with glory and honour.</hi> And Apoc. 4.10. <hi>Thou art worthy O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power.</hi> And Reu. 5.13. <hi>I heard all the Creatures ſaying: Praiſe and honour, and glory, and power be to him that ſitteth upon the throne.</hi> And Reu. 7.12. <hi>Praiſe, and glory and wiſdome, and thanks, and honour, and power, and might be unto our God forevermore, Amen.</hi>

                              <hi>(a) GOd wils his own infinite being. Therefore his will is infinite.]</hi> And we alſo will his being; that is, not only deſire that he be; but alſo love him, and deſire our ſelves in him, as being the cauſe and upholder of our preſent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and much more the hope of our happy Being hereafter: yet is not our will therefore infinite. It may ſeeme therefore that the firſt reaſon holds not. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. We will as farre as we know: For of that which is unknowne there is no deſire nor will; And wee know that He is; not what He is. For our moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine knowledge of Him (beſide that revelation which he hath made of himſelfe in his owne word) is rather by denying what he is not, than by affirming what he is. For although we follow by certaine ſteps of his imprinted in the Creature, and moſt of all in our owne underſtanding, that He is eternall, almighty, &amp;c. yet for all this we cannot apprehend in any degree what His infinite being, what his eternity, power, and goodneſſe is. But his knowledge of Himſelfe, equals His owne being. And becauſe his being is good, and deſireable, and a good knowne moves the will, and an infinite Good apprehended by an infinite knowledge moves an infinite Will; Therefore becauſe His infinite being is knowne to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be infinitely Good, doth hee alſo infinitely will and delight Himſelfe in His owne being and Goodneſſe. But our will or deſire of his being cannot ſtretch beyond our knowledge, which is alſo in the loweſt degree, as was declared in the entrance of the 5. <hi>chap.</hi> So God wils and loves His owne infinite Being, and is bleſſed, and glorious therein infinitely, and neceſſarily: but wee will and love Him, as farrers wee know, and are drawne neere to him by his Spirit, and promiſes.</p>

The Holy Text is the rule, and teaches the uſe of all. If the things be artificiall; conſider who it is that teacheth man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and to what end: ſo you finde the abuſe to avoyd the ſinne, and let your meditation dwell therein, by ſuch remembrances as the Scripture affords you. If naturall, remember likewiſe what you reade thereof in the holy Text, and ſo ſhall you bee led by the hand to the right uſe. For inſtance: In the ſight; the firſt object thereof is light: remember then what you reade. <hi>Thy word is a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne unto my feet, and a light unto my Paths.</hi> Then, <hi>ye are the children of the light, that ye ſhould not walke in darkeneſſe.</hi> And thus if you will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low your light and guide, the Spirit of Chriſt; you ſhall at laſt bee brought to him, that dwels in the light that none can approch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Adde your prayer hereto, that you may ſo be guided by the light of his word in this life, that you may ſee his everlaſting light in the world to come, you can turne you to no ſide, you can make uſe of none of your ſenſes, but if you remember what you reade concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that which your ſence lights on, you ſhall have all your ſenſes to guide you in the way to God, and to hold in that skittiſh imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that will draw you away and betray you, if you doe not hold herein. But of all theſe things, which draw us immediately to God, thoſe Attributes are chiefe which he hath taken to himſelfe by way of compariſon, wherein there is almoſt nothing ſo meane, or ſo vile, whither the kindneſſe and love of God hath not abaſed it ſelfe to winne our thoughts to Him, by our ſences. As <hi>Luke</hi> 15.30. <hi>Thou haſt for his ſake killed the fat calfe.</hi> All the ſacrifices of the Law, the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, the Temple, and all their furniture may be brought here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. And yet more meanely, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.37. <hi>Where the carcaſe is, thither will the Eagles be gathered.</hi> So Hoſ. 5.12. <hi>I wil be to Ephraim, as a moth, and to Iudah as rottenneſſe.</hi> You ſay, what is this to the matiers in hand? very much, For if I teach you the right uſe of your ſenſes, that your ſences by cuſtome maybe exerciſed to the diſcerning of things both good and ill; you ſhall by your knowledge and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in things ſenſible, have a ready way to the more eaſie appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of thoſe points of wiſdome, which are the matiers of faith concerning God. The Attributes which concerne his high, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perexcellent perfections I have proved to bee infinite; it muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that all thoſe perfections are but one abſolute wonderfull being, from which as from one fountaine they all ariſe. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though with us truely diſtinguiſhed, yet in Him are they but his owne moſt ſimple being; which may appeare by the enſuing reaſons.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. If all the excellencies of God, his goodneſſe, wiſdome, power, truth &amp;c. be not eſſentially in the perfection of his own being: then muſt they be in him, either as accidents ariſing from his being, or els they muſt come to him from without by ſome other. But in him
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:107656:31"/>there can be no accident (as ſhal appeare in the next chapter) neither yet can they come to Him from without. For ſo his being ſhould not be good, powerfull, nor true of it ſelfe, nor he wiſe in Himſelfe, but by the influence of another: So ſomething ſhould be given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, greater and more excellent then hee, from whom theſe perfections ſhould come unto him. For nothing can be in defect, but by ſomething which is in act or perfect being, which raiſed it from not being to that eſtate which it hath in poſſibilitie of further perfection. But it is granted at firſt, that nothing can bee of greater excellency than God. Therefore the dignities of God are eſſential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the perfection of his owne being, and ſo are his abſolute and eſſentiall Being.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Every thing whoſe goodneſſe, power, wiſdome, glory, &amp;c. are not eſſentially one with the being thereof, muſt of neceſſity be in defect, and in poſſibility only, to become that which it is not. But the being of God cannot bee ſuch. For ſo ſhould not he be God eternally. So alſo his goodneſſe, power, glory, &amp;c. ſhould not be infinite. But theſe things are impoſſible. Therefore his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, power, glory, &amp;c. are eſſentially his very being; And Hee is eſſentially his owne goodneſſe, glory, wiſdome, power, &amp;c. For the being is alwaies convertible with that whoſe being it is, as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man is a reaſonable creature, every reaſonable creature is a man, ſee, <hi>log. cap.</hi> 8. <hi>n.</hi> 2.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Whatſoever is ſimple and utterly uncompounded, muſt needs be pure and one in it ſelfe: neither can it be this, and that; one and another; for ſo the ſimplicitie were taken away. But the being of God is ſimple and uncompounded, as ſhall appeare by and by. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in Him is nothing but his owne pure eſſence or being. So then his goodneſſe, truth, wiſdome, glory, &amp;c. is no other thing than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; nor he any other thing than his goodneſſe, wiſdome, or glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry &amp;c. Nor his goodneſſe, any other thing in Him than his power &amp;c. nor his truth, than his wiſdome &amp;c. nor any other dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, any other thing than another, to wit, in that one perfection of his moſt pure and abſolute being, which compriſes all theſe. Which pure being, becauſe it is neither underſtandable, nor name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by us, we ſpeake of goodneſſe, of power, &amp;c. as of the effluen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or prime acts thereof, in which it is one, and they one in it, with the concord of ſameneſſe or unitie of being; but with reſpect of one toward another, they are this one, and that other, with the difference of concord, or concord of difference. For though wee ſay truly, goodneſſe, is God himſelfe, and God is wholly goodneſſe; yet not excluſively; For truth is God himſelfe, and God is wholly truth; yet not excluding Almightineſſe, eternity, &amp;c. Therefore goodneſſe, truth, eternity, &amp;c. are different with the difference of concord, not of oppoſition, ſee <hi>chap.</hi> 9. <hi>note (h)</hi>

                        <p n="4">4. Whatſoever hath the infinity of being, muſt of neceſſity bee eſſentially and actually, whatſoever it is poſſible to be. But God hath
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:107656:31"/>the infinity of being as was proved <hi>cap.</hi> 3. Therefore he muſt be. 1. of Neceſſitie, not by chance. 2. Eſſentially, not an accident, nor acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally: for ſo he might both be, and not be. 3. Actually whatſoever He is: not with poſſibility of being that which He is not: for ſo there ſhould be defect of being, which cannot ſtand with the infinitie of being. Therefore God is of neceſſity eſſentially, and actually good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, eternity, power, wiſdome, will, truth, glory, life, &amp;c. and convertibly. And this is it (as farre as I know) which God ſaith of himſelfe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.14. <hi>I am that I am, or I will be that which I will be.</hi> Whereby we may know, firſt that whatſoever is in God, is eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and actually himſelfe, as is ſhewed. Secondly, that all the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding or wiſdome of the Creature, Angels, &amp; Men, being all fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite. cannot conceive what he is in Himſelfe, being altogether infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite.

                        <p>Seeing then that all the excellencies of God in their infinitie are his very being; it followes from hence as a corollary or conſequence. Firſt, that God is wholly or abſoluely perfect in himſelfe. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he is but one.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. Where the whole power of being is infinitely, there no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency can bee wanting but as it hath the infinitie of being, and thereby differs infinitely from not being; ſo all defect or want muſt needs be farre therefrom. But the whole power of being is in God infinitely, as hath beene proved. Therefore God in himſelfe is wholly perfect.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Moreover ſeeing Hee is the firſt cauſe of all being, and tooke nothing from any other (as was ſhewed in the firſt reaſon) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is neceſſary that He be perfect in Himſelfe.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Whatſoever is actually all that it can be, muſt needs bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in it ſelfe. But God is ſuch (as was ſhewed in the fourth reaſon) Therefore God is pure perfection in himſelfe, not having any thing of weakeneſſe, of want, of poſſibility to be <hi rend="sup">a</hi> more excellent or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect than he is.</p>

                           </head>
                           <p n="1">1. An infinite being is that which holdeth all beings in it ſelfe, and is not it ſelfe comprehended of any other. By which it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that of infinites, there can bee but one, and conſequently but one God. For if there ſhould be mo Gods; every one infinite; then every one muſt hold in himſelfe the being of the other, and ſo ſtill there could be but one infinitie, and if they be not contained one of another, then they cannot be infinite, and ſo not God, who is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved to be infinite; and therefore but one.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. If there be ſeverall indiviſible almighties, or Gods of ſeverall infinite power; then it muſt follow, that none of theſe powers are abſolutely infinite, becauſe each one hath not the infinite power of the other: and beſides, that all theſe infinite powers are conjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with infinite weakeneſſe, becauſe they muſt bee mutually ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the infinite power one of another, or if they bee not ſubject each to others power, it will follow that none of their powers is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite. And ſo none of theſe ſuppoſed Gods, to bee God indeed. Therefore there is one only God Almighty.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Whatſoever is ſuperexcellent, muſt be ſuch as cannot bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualled by any other. For multitude abates the dignitie of one, as many kings of equall power in a commonwealth would make that ſtate no kingdome. And if there be many Gods, one muſt be equal'd with another, and ſo none ſhould bee ſuperexcellent. But it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in reaſon, and before proved, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>R.</hi> 3. that God is ſuper ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in all his dignities. <hi rend="sup">b</hi> Therefore God is one alone. This ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument with many other inductions to the like purpoſe you may reade in <hi>Athanaſius</hi> in his oration againſt the Gentiles.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. One individeable and peculiar being cannot belong to more than one, as the being of <hi>Thomas</hi> cannot be the very ſame being which is of <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Iohn,</hi> but the being underſtood by this name (God) is one individeable and peculiar being, as was put in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>cap.</hi> 1. therefore it cannot belong to more than one.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. If there be two Gods, or more, it is neceſſarie that they bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed by ſomething added either to one or to both; which addition, if it be an accident, whether it be of inherence, or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, will not make ſuch difference, but that in eſſence they may be one: and if no accident can be in God (as ſhall by and by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare) then this kinde of difference will bee none: but if the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion make an eſſentiall difference, then the being muſt be compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: but ſuch a being cannot be God, which muſt be independent, and uncompounded.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. Beſides, ſeeing they muſt be in the higheſt degree of being, and that He unto whom wee confeſſe, is proved to be infinitely and eſſentially good, wiſe, powerfull, true, glorious, eternall, &amp;c. it muſt needs bee, that whatſoever differs therefrom in the exceſſe of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                              <hi>(a) TO be more excellent or perfect than Hee. Corol.</hi> 1. <hi>Re.</hi> 3.] <hi>Tho. Aquinas lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 28. <hi>cont. Gent.</hi> to this concluſion brins another reaſon; which is this. In every kinde or order of beings there is ſomething moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, whereby every thing in that kinde is to be meaſured, becauſe that the greater or leſſe perfection of every thing is tryed, by how much it is nearer to to that moſt perfect being, or further off: therefore in the order of being alſo, there muſt be one thing moſt perfect, which is God; who if hee were not moſt perfect, could not be the common meaſure of all things. For reſpect to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I would faine have let this reaſon ſtand, but that it ſtands not with reaſon nor the truth: for it puts the Creator and the creature in one ranke or order of being, and the difference onely in degrees of perfection, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, which can no way bee admitted: for the being of God is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, and of it ſelfe; the being of the creature is onely of Him; His infinite, theirs finite: and how can that which is infinite, be a meaſure to that which is finite? what proportion is there betweene them? doth not the Creator which is infinite differ as much from that which is in the higheſt perfection of being created and finite, as from that which is in the loweſt? doth not he as much exceed an Angell, or a man, as the leaſt mote of duſt on the earth? how then is that true which the Prophet hath, <hi>Eſay</hi> 40.15.17. <hi>All nations are unto him as nothing, yea leſſe than nothing; and vanitie, as the duſt in the balance,</hi> which no man puffs away becauſe it hath no weight. And that he ſhould thinke this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon good, or the compariſon tollerable, is ſo much the more to bee marvelled at; becauſe that in the ſame booke, <hi>Chap.</hi> 32. he proves that nothing can bee affirmeable of God and the creature univocably, but onely analogically <hi>Chap.</hi> 34. And againe, in his queſtions on the firſt booke of <hi>the Senten. diſt.</hi> 8. <hi>q.</hi> 6.7. Though all created beings be brought into the orders and diſtributions of being, which wee call predicaments, either directly or collaterally: yet hee proves that God can no way bee brought into any predicament; and that becauſe his being conteines the excellencies of all beins, as the cauſe and ſuſteiner of all. And if he cannot come into the predicament of ſubſtance, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as the moſt generall ſubſtance affirmeable of all, o as any thing conteined thereunder, becauſe his being is ſimple and without addition, or difference; much leſſe can be be brought into any other predicament. And if wiſdome be in God, as his very being, and ſubſtance; but in an Angell as a qualitie onely: What affinitie or neereneſſe can there be betweene a qualitie in one, and the ſubſtance of another? therefore the compariſon of perfection and imperfection is in the creatures onely, and not with the Creator: for as the diſtance is end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe from not being to being; and therefore the leaſt atome could not bee brought out from not being into being but by an infinite power; ſo againe from
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:107656:33"/>a finite being, how excellent ſoever in reſpect of other finites, the diſtance is as great to a being that is infinite. For as in a number actually infinite (if any ſuch could be) five could not be conteined oftner than ten, nor one than five; ſo the greateſt perfection of a finite being, is as neere unto nothing, and as much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by an infinite Being, as that which is accounted the meaneſt of Beings.</p>

But if not beleeving them, they thought themſelves forced to proclaime them Hereticks that were ſaid to doe ſuch deeds. Becauſe the ſhatneleſſe lying Ethnicks put ſuch things upon the Chriſtians, by the malice of the Devill invented, onely to diſgrace the glorious faith: it was a worſe deede to brand the Chriſtian name with ſuch villanie, onely becauſe the enemies of the faith were paſt all ſhame to lay ſuch things to their charge. For in all heatheniſme you ſhall not read of any deeds ſo roule, of any opinions ſo farre from reaſon: but if they whom they call hereticks were only the cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of all opinions in thoſe times, themſelves being Libertines of Atheiſts, and ſo among other their opinions broached what liked them beſt concerning Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity; I ſee no reaſon why they ſhould be called Hereticks more than <hi>Celſus, Porphyrie, Lucian,</hi> and ſuch profeſſed adverſaries, or any of the Philoſophers that were before: for if hee onely can bee an Hereticke, who being baptiſed, doth ſtubbornely maintaine a falſe opinion contrarie to ſome article of our faith; How can the <hi>Manichees</hi> be counted Hereticks who were neither bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, nor acknowledged one God, nor beleeved his Scriptures, but as another prophane writing ſo farre as they liked it; who worſhip't the Sanne, the Moon, and all their Idoles: and although they celebrated their aſſemblies in comming together as the Chriſtians; yet can you account thoſe myſteries of <hi>Beelzebub</hi> to be Chriſtian, which were performed with ſuch accurſed uncleanneſſe; as I muſt forbeare to write; which I could hardly have beene brought to beleeve, if S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> himſelfe, who had been among them, and proves it by witneſſes, had not recorded it <hi>de Haereſ. Cap.</hi> 46. The filthines of the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> was yet more abhominable, if it be poſſible to be true which they write; will you account them Chriſtians? The Philoſopher <hi>Plotinus,</hi> no Chriſtian <hi>Ennead.</hi> 2. <hi>lib</hi> 9. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled againſt the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> ſhewes the falſhood of their opinions concerning the creating of the world; and proves that in the government thereof their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was more wicked than that of <hi>Epicurus:</hi> and though <hi>Simon</hi> the Sorcerer was baptiſed, <hi>Acts.</hi> 8. yet when his gall of bitterneſſe had made him a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed enemie, and father of all thoſe hereſies that followed; will you count him a Chriſtian? Therefore you may with the Apoſtle ſay of theſe, of <hi>Cerin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus,</hi> of <hi>Carpocrates,</hi> and of many of the reſt; <hi>They went out from us, but they were not of us.</hi> But becauſe I am buſied in things of more importance than this (and yet the honour of the Chriſtian name is no ſmall matier) I will moſt brieflie recount the contrarie opinions, whether they be of the elder Philoſophers, or the later Hereticks, as they have beene gathered, by the moſt ancient among the Fathers, <hi>Irenaus, Epiphanius,</hi> S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and others: I ſay, moſt briefly and onely for a taſte, that you may love the truth the better, and adore that mercy which hath manifeſted it unto us. And therefore I will not tell you of <hi>Varros</hi> thouſands of gods, nor trouble you needleſlie with remembrance of thoſe gods of the Heathen, which you may reade in the holy Scripture, and know better by Maſter <hi>Seldens</hi> juſt Commentarie <hi>de Djs Syris,</hi> if you underſtand Latin.</p>
                           <p>§ 2. Above fortle diſagreeing opinions among the Philoſophers concerning the gods, are reckoned up by <hi>Cic. de natura Deorum. lib.</hi> 1. of which ſome
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:107656:33"/>directly gainſay this concluſion of the Vnitie of the Godhead: for although <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſthenes</hi> confeſſed there was but one God, the God of all nature; yet he added, that there were divers Gods for divers peoples and countries. <hi>Xenocrates</hi> ſaid there were eight gods, in the ſeven planets, and one that ruled over all the Starres. <hi>Anaximander</hi> held many gods, and ſo many gods, ſo many worlds; but ſaid that theſe gods were brought forth in time, and after many ages dyed againe. <hi>Alomeon</hi> ſeemed to acknowledge three gods, inaſmuch as he gives di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitie to the Sunne, to the Moone, and to the ſoule of man. <hi>Xenophanes</hi> would have all that is infinite to be god, whether in being, or in working, as he held the underſtanding. <hi>Democritus</hi> would have all the <hi>Ideas</hi> or repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of things being, and that underſtanding whence they proceed, and mans underſtanding alſo to be gods. The inconſtancle of the Philoſophers in their owne opinions brought us in yet more gods. <hi>Cleanthes</hi> one while ſaid the world was god, ſometime the ſoule, whereby it was quickned, and governed; then againe the pure and uppermoſt ayre that compaſſeth the whole Globe of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth; ſometime the Starres, other while reaſon; as ſo the reſt, as you may heare hereafter. And if the Philoſophers, the guides were blind, it is no marvell though the blockiſh rout ran into all Idolatrie, as they are deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed <hi>Wiſd. Chap.</hi> 14. But to ſuppoſe it reaſonable to give honour to the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the dead, who where founders of cities, or procurers of ſome great and publike good, becauſe they (though dead) were thought to favour and maintaine their owne endeavours: or to be ſo unreaſonable, as to thinke with the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> that there was ſomething divine in all thoſe things by which they received any kinde of good; and ſo to worſhip men, horſes, birds, ſerpents, wolves, dogs, and cats. <hi>See Iuvenall. Sat.</hi> 15. <hi>Cic. de natura Deorum lib.</hi> 3. yet what could ſo mad the old <hi>Romanes</hi> not onely to allow all the hee gods, and the ſhee gods of others; but to conſecrate imaginations, as Victory, Concord, Peace; yea and among theſe their owne plagues and puniſhments, as the Ague, Mildew, and blaſting, ill fortune, &amp;c? <hi>Cic. loc. cit.</hi>

                           <p>§ 3. But there was no opinion among all theſe more fooliſh than that which went out in the name of the Hereticks. <hi>Cerdon</hi> firſt of all <hi>Auguſt. cont. adverſ. leg. &amp; Proph. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 12. ſaid there were two gods; one good, whom they called <hi>Oeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazes,</hi> and another ſtark naught, whom they named <hi>Areimanius.</hi> This opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion his ſcholer <hi>Marcion</hi> upheld, but added<note n="*" place="margin">Tertullian, who diſputes againſt him in ſive books, hath it not, nor <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> brings it doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully out of <hi>Epiphanius.</hi>
                              </note> a third whom he called the <hi>Iuſt.</hi> After that the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> reeal'd the opinion of the two gods with many addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The <hi>Manichees</hi> alſo followed this madneſſe, and added their fiction, that the good God ſet upon the wicked god to have ſuppreſt him. but in that conflict the powers of darkeneſſe tooke many parts of the good god priſoners, and tyed them unto earthly matiers; for the ranſoming of which, this good but verie weake god, takes great thought, but as theſe parts of his come to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the matiers wherein they are tyed, by their Cathariſts or Puritanes, they are parted from the impure matiers, and ſo reſtored to the God againe. Are theſe Hereticks? are theſe Chriſtians? found you any thing like to this among the pure naturalliſts of the heathen? <hi>Phil. Mornay de verit. Chriſt. Relig. Cap.</hi> 2. drawes this opinion of two gods by the autoritie of <hi>Plutarch de Iſide &amp; Oſiride.</hi> Firſt from <hi>Zoroaſter,</hi> and ſo among the <hi>Perſians:</hi> thence to the <hi>Manichees.</hi> It is true, that <hi>Manes</hi> their father was a <hi>Perſian;</hi> but it is manifeſt that <hi>Plutarch</hi> was moſt groſly deceived, firſt in the circumſtance of the time, wherein hee mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes about ſome foure thouſand two hundred yeeres, a great fault in an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian: for if <hi>Zoroaſter</hi> lived in the reigne of <hi>Ninus,</hi> as the beſt Records doe make him, <hi>See Fra. Patr. in Zor.</hi> about three hundred yeeres after the floud, it will not be above eight hundred ninetie, or nine hundred yeeres before the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> which is put about the yeare of the world two thouſand eight hundred fortie; ſo that <hi>Plutarch</hi> who makes him to have lived five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:107656:34"/>yeares before the deſtruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> makes him above two thouſand yeeres elder than <hi>Adam.</hi> Then in the ſubſtance of the matier, the miſtaking is nothing leſſe: for by the diligence of worthy men, divers of thoſe magicall oracles of <hi>Zoroaſter,</hi> who was the Sonne of <hi>Oromazes, Plato Alcib.</hi> 1. are come to light, and printed at <hi>Paris</hi> in the yeare one thouſand ſixe hundred and ſeven, and before that many more of them gathered out of the old autors by <hi>Fra. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricius,</hi> and printed at <hi>Venice</hi> 1593. and ſince that elſewhere. By which it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent that <hi>Zoroaſter</hi> held the myſterie of the Trinitie, in Unitie of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itie, and one Godabove all, the Creator of all things, who according to his owne goodneſſe made every thing perfect and good, as his words witneſſe.</p>

From theſe, and eſpecially from <hi>Menander</hi> and the <hi>Nicholaitans,</hi> proceeded the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> though not under that name til afterward. Theſe vaunted of all knowledge, &amp; held <hi>Plato</hi> as one that knew little or nothing of Philoſophie; And this their high knowledge they boaſted to have out of the Oracles of <hi>Zoroa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> which they pretended to have, &amp; thence falſly gave out what they liſt, to bring the holy Scripture into contempt. By the falſhood and impudency of theſe it ſeems that <hi>Plutarch</hi> was deceived; which yet is further manifeſt in this, that in the ſame place, <hi>de Iſ. &amp; os.</hi> hee mentions the opinion of the <hi>Chialiſts,</hi> as the doctrine of <hi>Zoroaſter:</hi> wherein by his gloſſe <hi>Cerinthus</hi> had corrupted the holy Text <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20. as the <hi>Turks</hi> at this day underſtand their Paradiſe. Now this doctrine of heaven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth (for ought that ever I read) was never mentioned in any prophane Writer before the time of S. <hi>Iohn:</hi> but it was no new matier for <hi>Plutarch</hi> to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in matiers of Religion; as well that of the <hi>Chaldees,</hi> further from his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; as in the Swine and Aſſe of the Iewes; which he might have knowne bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if by the <hi>Iewes</hi> themſelves he would have beene informed: <hi>See I.S. de Diis Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris ſynt.</hi> 2. <hi>Ca.</hi> 16. But to returne to our Hereticks; for all theſe follies and contrary opinions afore mentioned, if you compare with the reaſons and authorities afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, will vaniſh into nothing. Of all the hereſies about this point there is none ſo wicked, as that which <hi>Auguſtine</hi> writes ſomewhere to <hi>Baſilides, Contr. Adver. leg. ſupra;</hi> who firſt durſt affirme, that the God which the Nation of the Iewes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:107656:34"/>was not the true God; Then he writes that <hi>Carpocrates,</hi> denyed that God gave the Law to <hi>Moſes:</hi> elſwhere that <hi>Cerdon</hi> affirmed, that ther God of the Law and the Prophets was not the Father of Chriſt, <hi>de haer Cap.</hi> 21. this laſt the Iewes like well of; but to us all theſe are one hereſie, who hold according to that which is <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. That God which at ſundry times, and after ſundry manners had ſpoken of old to the Fathers, ſpake to us in theſe laſt dayes by his ſonne. For evidence of which, becauſe it is the ground of all our hopes, you ſhall have a reaſon or two; and if you deſire more, read the bookes of <hi>Tertullian</hi> againſt <hi>Marcion,</hi> eſpecially the third, fourth, and fift.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. § 4. If that God, which was honoured by the Nation of the Iewes, whom the Chriſtians acknowledge the Father of Chriſt, be not the true God; then it will follow, either that the true God hath hitherto beene utterly unknowne to the world, or elſe that ſome of thoſe falſe gods (as we terme them) whom the heathens worſhipped, as <hi>Jupiter, Iuno, Neptune, &amp;c.</hi> muſt be the true God: But both theſe things are falſe. Therefore the God which the nation of the <hi>Iewes</hi> adored was the true God. Now that none of the gods of the heathens could be the true God is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by this; that (although they were lyars) yet durſt never any of them take this to himſelfe, that he was God; as may appeare by the anſwer of that <hi>Apollo</hi> of <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros,</hi> where after a long deſcription of God, by which yet hee would uphold devill-worſhip, he concludes with a lye of him and his fellowes: <gap reason="foreign">

This is God: but wee Angels are a little portion of God: where (you ſee) to ſave his credit and uphold his ſacrifices he gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe out as a part of God, s if the being of God were diviſible into parts. Moreover, whereas the true God in regard of his Lordſhip and power over the creature, might challenge the ſervice and obedience thereof and give rules how he would be worſhipped thereby, as he did to <hi>Abraham, Moſes, &amp;c.</hi> yet none of theſe devills ever taught their worſhippers any other ſervice to themſelves, but as enemies of mankinde to<note n="*" place="margin">Reade further to this purpoſe the ſecond booke of <hi>S.

And in prophane writers, who knowes not the altar of the ſhe-devill among the <hi>Tauri,</hi> which had no ſacrifices, but of mands blood, ſtrangers, and enemies overcome in warre?

Compare herewith the anſwers of God to <hi>Gedeon,</hi> to <hi>David, &amp;c.</hi> As their wiſdome, ſuch was their goodneſſe: for what can bee remembred wherein any of theſe devils did ever any good to any nation, countrie, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or private man, wherein the providence and wiſdome of man was not chiefe? as you may account the ſafetie of the <hi>Athenians</hi> in their wooden wals at <hi>Salantis,</hi> to the wiſdome of <hi>Themiſtocles.</hi> And although <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lux</hi> ſaved <hi>Simonides</hi> for his ſong, yet they ſlew his hoſte and all his friends.

If then neither any of the heathen gods were the true God, neither yet can it ſtand with the Goodneſſe, Iuſtice, or Truth of the true God, to denie to man that knowledge of himſelfe, which man was capable of; nor to refuſe that ſervice which hee could doe Him: it muſt needs follow of neceſſitie, that the God which the Nation of the <hi>Jewes</hi> worſhipped, which we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Father of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is the true God; and this his devilſhip was forced to acknowledge.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. NO matier is eternall. But God is eternall: <hi rend="sup">a</hi> therefore God is not matier. The rule or propoſition is thus proved. Whatſoever is moved by any kinde of motion cannot be eternall: becauſe it ſuppoſes another being whereby it is moved, either from
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:107656:36"/>the pure poſſibilitie of not being into being, as the firſt matier of all things; or in being, from one ſtate of being into another. But all matier is one of theſe: therefore no matier is, or can be eternall; and therefore not God. And if no matier can be God, then God cannot be matier. <hi>See log. Cap.</hi> 13. <hi>B. rule</hi> 1.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. All matier is in poſſibilitie to become this or that; that is, to change from one forme to another, as the moiſture of the earth by the Vertue of the root turnes to graſſe, thence by the vertue of the ſtomacke of the oxe, becomes blood, then fleſh; which in the ſtomacke of the man being digeſted againe, becomes his blood, then fleſh, and ſo returnes to earth againe, and is capable of as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny formes or ſhapes as it was before. But God is actually whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he is, and without poſſibilitie of change to become this or that. Therefore God is not matier.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. No matier is a beginning of naturall action, but of ſufferance onely. But God is the beginning of all naturall actions. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God is not matier, you may bring hither divers of the reaſons following in 2.3.4.</p>

                              <hi>Section. 2.</hi> That God is not the forme of other things being.</head>
                           <p n="1">1. Every naturall compound is a third thing ariſing from the matier and the forme, in which <hi rend="sup">b</hi> the parts that were before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood ſeparate, had power to be joyned, and to become that which they were not before. But God can neither be a part of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, nor be joyned with another, nor be in poſſibilitie to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor yet become that which he was not before. Therefore He is neither matier nor forme.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. No forme is totally and onely for the being of it ſelfe, <hi rend="sup">c</hi> but is deſtinate unto another totall, as a thing more excellent than it ſelfe. But God is wholly his owne being onely, not for another; for all things are for him: neither can any thing be more excellent than He. Therefore <hi rend="sup">d</hi> God is not the forme of any other being.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. No forme of any thing begun can be e ternall. But God is eternall: therefore God is not the forme of any thing begun. And ſo yu may conclude likewiſe of matier.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. The matier and forme are the eſſentiall being of al bodilie things, and being is affirmable of that, whoſe being it is. If God then were the being of other things, it were as truely ſaid, This man is God, as this man is a living creature indued with reaſon; but this is moſt falſe, and would juſtifie the Idolatrie of all the heathen, yea even of the <hi>Aegyptians.</hi> Therfore God is neither matier nor form. And if God be neither matier nor forme, it muſt needs follow.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. FOr in every compound the parts being actually ioyned muſt needs be ſuch as were poſſible to be ioyned together, ſo that there muſt be therein both actor perfection, in reſpect of the totall wherin the parts are actually ioyned, and poſſibilitie or imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in regard of the parts that may be both ioyned, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently diſloyned againe: ſo that the totall in poſſibility not to be, as it was not before the parts were ioyned together. But nothing of all this is poſſible to bee in God: neither parts, nor imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; nor poſſibilitie to be, and not to be, <hi rend="sup">e</hi> Therefore God is no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Every Compound is a ſecond thing in Nature, whoſe being followes upon the uniting of the parts compounded. But God is the prime or firſt being, as was ſhewed. Therefore no compound.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Every compound ſuppoſeth neceſſarily a cauſe efficient which brought the parts together; which cauſe efficient muſt needs be before the effect or compound. But nothing of this belongs to God. Therefore He is no compound.</p>
                           <p>Every compound is liable to diviſion, and ſo to deſtruction. But this is againſt the eternity of God; and therefore God is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound or made of divers things. And if no compound, then neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily it follows.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. FOr every body whether it be Phyſicall, or Mathematicall hath parts divideable into parts. It is alſo finite, and may be meaſured. But nothing of all this belongs to God, one infinite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi rend="sup">f</hi> Therefore God is not a Body.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. No bodily being can bee the firſt of Beings, and the cauſe of all other: For if it be a body onely, it cannot poſſibly move it ſelfe: And if it bee a bodie enlived and quickned by another, then it cannot bee the firſt of beings, becauſe it is compounded. But God is the firſt, and cauſe of all beings, as hath beene proved. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no Body.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. No bodily being is abundantly ſufficient for it ſelfe. For if it bee a whole and entire body, it needs the parts, without which it could not be whole; and if it bee a part, it needs the other parts as helpers, and the whole as the ſuſtayner; And yet the outward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or cauſer which brought altogether. But God is abundantly ſufficient for himſelfe; of whom alone all other things have their ſufficiencie. Therefore God is no body. And if God in himſelfe be

                           <p n="1">1. FOr every Accident, whether it bee of Inherence, or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, comes to the ſubject beſide the being thereof. The accidents of circumſtance come to the ſubject, for the better being thereof; as to bee clothed, to have a wife, &amp;c. But all theſe come from without; And as they are needleſſe to him that hath all ſufficiency without; And as they are needleſſe to him that hath all ſufficiency in Himſelfe, ſo are they impoſſible to belong unto God. The accidents of inherence proceede either form the matier, forme, or compoſition of the ſubject. In God is neither matier, forme or compoſition, as hath bin proved, <hi rend="sup">g</hi> Therefore in God is no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 Nothing can be in any thing moſt excellently and perfectly but only the being thereof. Whatſoever is in God is in Him moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently and perfectly. Therefore whatſoever is in God is only his being; And then no accident.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. If no addition can be unto God, to make him any thing other than He is; then can no accident be in him: which ever makes the ſubject ſomewhat that it was not before. But no addition, taking away, or change can come to Him, who is eternally, infinitely, and actually whatſoever Hee may bee. Therefore no accident can bee in God.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Every Accident is neere unto not being, as having no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but in that ſubject wherein it is. But the being of God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely diſtant from not being. And therefore God is no way ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Accidents.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. If any thing can come to God as an Accident, it muſt come to Him, either from Himſelfe, or from another. Not from himſelfe, as having neither matier, forme, compoſition, or bodily being, from which all accidents doe proceed. Neither can it ſuffer any thing from another; for all ſuch accidents as proceed from without, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the poſſibilitie, or weakneſſe of the ſubject unable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, as heat is in water. But his being is infinitely perfect and ſuch as cannot ſuffer: For ſo ſhould be ceaſe to be happy, and to be God; and therefore nothing can be in him but eſſentially.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. And moreover ſeeing Hee is the firſt of all beings, and the onely thing being of himſelfe eternally; it is impoſſible that hee ſhould either ſuffer violence, or have any thing added to him by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, or be moved by another; ſeeing he is the firſt cauſe &amp; mover of all things. If then no accident can be in God, neither from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, nor yet from without; it is manifeſt that in him can be no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident at all. And ſeeing nothing of all theſe things before ſpoken
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:107656:37"/>matter, forme, compoſition, body or accident can bee in God, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes neceſſarily.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. VVHich is further manifeſt by this. That He is the firſt of beings, and ſo muſt needs be ſimple. And againe, that which is ſimple, muſt needs bee the firſt. For that which is not the firſt of all beings, muſt needs have dependance on another, and ſo two things muſt be therein. Firſt ſomewhat from the cauſe whereby it is; Secondly ſomewhat peculiar to it ſelfe, whereby it differs from the cauſe. But God is the firſt of all Beings, becauſe he is eternall and one, as was proved, <hi>cap.</hi> 2. &amp; 8. <hi rend="sup">h</hi> Therefore his being is moſt ſimple and pure.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. If nothing can be in God, but only his owne eſſence or being, then purity it ſelfe, or ſimplicity muſt needs bee his being: which being, becauſe it is proved to be infinite, it neceſſarily followes that his purity is alſo infinite, beyond which no purity or ſimplicitie can be greater.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Whatſoever is infinite and no way limitted muſt needs bee moſt ſimple or uncompounded and onely one. The being of God is infinite; Therefore moſt ſimple and pure.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. God is no compound, as was proved, therefore his being is moſt ſimple.</p>
                           <p>And becauſe all our knowledge which wee have of all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is only by the helpe of our ſenſes, taking them either directly or further of by compariſon, by compoſition, or by negation; whereby we judge of the properties or accidents which we finde in the things; and not by the underſtanding of the moſt inward and true being thereof; no not of our owne very ſoules, whereby we live, or that whereby wee are moſt guided, our verie imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; we muſt confeſſe that this higheſt and firſt being of all, being ſo utterly without all our ſenſes, muſt needs be as farre beyond all our moſt finite underſtanding; Neither that wee can aſſigne any name which may equall his being, ſee <hi>Cuſan. de Deo abſcondito.</hi> And that we may ends as we did begin, let us returne by the waies wee came, and we ſhall finde that all theſe names and beings, which wee have given unto God, yea even all together cannot equall him. For if we call him the beginning of all things, wee make him not an abſolute Being, but ſpeake with relation to that which is began. If wee ſay he is infinitie eternitie, power, wiſdome, and the reſt of thoſe dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities which we have viewed, they are but ſo many particular eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall attributes to one moſt perfect being: yet when wee have ſaid
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:107656:38"/>
                              <hi>Moſt perfect Being,</hi> we have not ſaid right. For He by his Infinity and Almightines is utterlie beyond both being &amp; not being, for he hath power over not being to make it to be, &amp; over being to make it not to be: Neither can not being be even verie nothing, but by him that commanded it to be nothing. Such therefore is He, Infinite beyond both being, and not being. If we ſay he is moſt perfect only, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not underſtanding his perfection to be any thing elſe than the union of his eſſentiall attributes. If by unity though moſt ſimple and abſolute without reſpect to number or magnitude, we ſay he is One; yet wee cannot truly ſay ſo, but by his truth.

And although the endeavour be high and hard, yet have wee ſo much the more encouragement by the helps or meanes of our knowledge; and ſo much the greater hopes in reſpect of the reward. The meanes common to every man are in ſum either diſcurſive; or experimentall. The diſcurſive are two, and in our power; two are experimentall and above it, but yet not hopeleſſe if wee endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. The firſt of theſe diſcurſive wayes whereby wee endevour to come to the knowledge of God, is by denying unto Him all thoſe things which are common; and every where meeting our ſences; ſuch are all things, that have matier, outward ſhape, compoſition, that are bodily; ſubject to motion, place, time, and other accidents. And hitherto you muſt bring all thoſe things which are ſpoken in the holy Scripture by way of Example and for our underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding onely, as when God is ſaid to have hands, feet, eyes, jealouſie, anger, and ſuch like, wherein wee muſt forſake that which is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and ſenſible, and inward in our ſelves, becauſe theſe titles are only to lift up our underſtanding by ſenſible and well known things to thoſe that are truly and eſſentiall in him; as by his hand, is meant his power; by his feet, his continuall preſence in every place; by his eyes, his wiſdome; by his jealouſie and anger, his juſtice againſt Sinners, &amp;c. And thus by the helpe of our ſenſes in things that are,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:107656:38"/>and in things that are not, our underſtanding is furthered in the knowledge of God; and that eſpecially if in both theſe wayes of diſcourſe, that is, denying things that agree not to God, and affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thoſe honourable dignities that are due unto him, we uſe the rule and guidance of the holy Scripture, and the ſtrangth of our beſt underſtanding, to approve thoſe things that are excelelnt, and to reprove that which ſtands not with his truth, as I have already ſhewed in both kinds, as well as I can.</p>
                           <p>The firſt of thoſe wayes that are experimentall in the knowledge of God are thoſe inbred thoughts, and apprehenſions of Him, whereby every man, will he, nill he, confeſſes in his heart that there is ſomething greater than himſelfe, whereof hee ſtands in awe and dread; which hee cannot chuſe but acknowledge an avenger of all wickedneſſe and ſinne. And this the witneſſe of God in every man, his conſcience within accuſing or excuſing him, in the judgement of his own heart. This <hi>Plotinus</hi> often, &amp; <hi>Iamblichus De myſt. cap.</hi> 1. call the touch of the deity, and affirme truely that it is more powerfull o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the minde than that diſcurſive knowledge of which I ſpake before. But becauſe this knowledge is ever with affrighting, and addreſſed onely as the two former, to the laſt: it beſeemes every man that would know God truely, as hee may bee knowne for his owne comfort, to cleanſe his owne heart with all his diligence, in prayer, in meditation, in reading of the holy Scripture, in denying of himſelfe in all his ungodlie and ſinnefull luſts; that he may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a holy and a meet Temple for God to dwell in. And ſo hee may aſſure himſelfe that God will give him experience of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; as hee hath promiſed, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.23. <hi>That hee will come and make his abode with him.</hi> This is that wiſe merchant who for this pretious pearle ſels all that hee hath, to buy it.

                              <hi>(a) GOd is not matier] Anaximenes</hi> ſaid the aire was God; that he was therfore unmeaſureable, but had a beginning, &amp; was always in motion. <hi>Diagoras</hi> of <hi>Apollonia</hi> (for he of <hi>Melos</hi> was the Atheiſt) conſented unto him as concerning the matier. The opinion of <hi>Cleanthes</hi> I told you before, which one while held God to bee matier in this ſenſible world, in the uppermoſt ayre and in the Statres. <hi>Parmenides</hi> imagined a mighty wide circle which encompaſt the world like a Crowne or garland (therefore called by him <hi>Stephane</hi>) to be God. <hi>Xenophon,</hi> and with him <hi>Plato</hi> where hee ſpeakes in ieſt, ſaith the word was God, which we
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:107656:39"/>call Mammon, and yeelds there were more ſuch, but where he ſpeakes in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, (as in his Epiſtles) hee ſpeakes of one God the Author of all things, as we doe. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> could not tell how to gaine-ſay his maſter with his owne credit, and ſo followed his judgement. <hi>Heraclides</hi> of <hi>Pontus</hi> ſomewhiles ſaid the Starres were Gods, then heaven, and earth. So <hi>Theophraſtus,</hi> and ſometime <hi>Zeno</hi> was for the Starres, <hi>Chriſippus</hi> that was accounted moſt ſubtile amongſt the ſchollers of <hi>Zeno,</hi> was moſt wavering in his opinions; ſometime he thought the world was God: ſometime the uttermoſt or burning aire: then water: now earth; after this ayre below; and by and by the Sunne, and the Moone, and the Starres, at laſt all together was but one God, yet men canonized for their vertues muſt needs bee Gods apart; and then much more the vertues for which they were immortall. And thus they that would ſeeme wiſe, while they cared to know more than the truth of God, became idle in their imaginations, and there fooliſh heart was full of darkeneſſe.</p>

                              <hi>The parts which were before ſeparate.</hi> 2.1.] <hi>(b)</hi> All parts are underſtood apart, as things differing.

For it is not ſaid that God is utterly no forme. For forme is the moſt ſimple or pure being which wee can conceive; but he is none of thoſe formes, which are allyed to matier. The Angels are accounted formes, but ſeparate. But I runne not with that opinion.

His opinion that reaſon was God, was an errour, againſt this concluſion alſo, if by reaſon hee meant that reaſonable ſoule, the former of mans body. <hi>Heraclides</hi> ſuppoſed God to change his ſhape at his pleaſure. <hi>Zeno</hi> ſaid that reaſon in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing was God, or that he was that living law, that gave life to everything.

                              <hi>Therefore God is not a body.</hi> 4.1.] <hi>(f)</hi> The ſchoole of <hi>Epicurus</hi> taught that God was in ſhape like a man; and that he was alſo bodily. For they thought that if hee were without a body (as <hi>Plato</hi> taught) he could neither have ſence nor wiſdome, and ſo could no way be partaker of any pleaſure, or happines. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the pleaſure which God enjoyes, <hi>Plato</hi> teaches, <hi>Epiſt. ad Dionyſ.</hi> that it is not in outward or bodily things; which hinder the happineſſe of the minde. The weaknes of <hi>Epicurus</hi> argument is ſhewed by <hi>Cotta</hi> a follower of <hi>Plato, Cic. de Nat. D. l.</hi> 1 &amp; the opinion it ſelfe confuted by the arguments here brought; eſpecially againſt the <hi>Audean</hi> hereticks, that were called <hi>Anthropomorphites,</hi> whoupheld the opinion of the <hi>Epicurean</hi> Philoſophers, becauſe the holy Scripture, teaching men by their ſenſes, ſpeakes of Gods powerfull right hand, and treading down his enemies; that hee was ſorry in heart, and ſpecially where it is ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.

                              <hi>Therefore in God is no accident,</hi> 5.1.] <hi>Zeno (g)</hi> ſometime affirmed that the yeare and the ſeaſons thereof, the ſpring, the harveſt, the moneths alſo were God. <hi>Chriſippus</hi> ſaid, the truth of things was God. And if you account truth an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, you may referre his opinion hither. You have now heard the difference of opinions among the Philoſophers; But how much wiſer was <hi>Simonides</hi> that learned Poet, who being demanded by <hi>Hiero</hi> king of <hi>Siracuſe,</hi> what God was; He deſired a day to thinke of his anſwer: being the next day asked againe, he deſired two dayes: And thus being often asked, ſtill doubled his time. Being demaunded the reaſon, he anſwered, that the longer he thought thereon, the more hard and darke the thing ſeemed unto him. What thanks therefore can we give unto God who by his holy word hath ſo fully revealed himſelfe unto us, that the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels themſelues with wonder deſire to pry into thoſe myſteries, which hee hath made manifeſt unto his Church by Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. <hi>Therefore his being is moſt ſimple.</hi> 6.1.] Againſt this concluſion, a doubt or two may be raiſed. 1. being without addition, is affirmable of every thing. But the being of God is not ſo. For wee ſay the body, or ſoule of a Man, or an Angell is being, yet not God. Therefore the being of God is not a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may be diſtinguiſhed from other beings, it will ſeeme not to be a ſimple, but a compound being. I anſwer, that the propoſition being without addition, is affirmable of every thing, is true of that common predicate or tranſcendent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely of which I ſpeake, <hi>Introd. logic. ſect.</hi> 3. <hi>n.</hi> 2. &amp; 3. But the being of God is that one proper and pure being which belongs to him alone, and receives no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, nor is affirmable of any other thing beſide himſelfe. Secondly, I anſwer, that the concluſion of this ſyllogiſme, the being of God is not without additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being granted, takes not away the former concluſion, that his being is ſimple and pure; Neither is the conſequence rightly gahtered thereon: that if Addition be made, it is not then a ſimple being. For theſe additions bring in no ſuch beings, as to make the being of God either compound, or mixt, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinguiſhable from other beings. For to ſay the being of God is one, is pure, is ſimple, is incommunicable, are here onely negation differences, as one, therefore it cannot belong to any beſide himſelfe; Pare, that is, not mixt. Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that is, not compounded. Incommunicable, whereof none can be partaker beſide himſelfe. Nay, thoſe very poſitive additions of Goodneſſe, eternity, infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, power, wiſdome, &amp;c. are not additions of new beings, but onely eſſential con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the ſame moſt ſimple being diſtinguiſhed by us in our underſtanding. For, becauſe our underſtanding receives nothing but by the ſences from the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; Therefore when it findes theſe ſeverall perfections in the creature, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges that no perfection can be in the effect, which is not more eminently and excellently in the cauſe thereof; it is compelled, as it received theſe perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the creature with differences, ſo alſo to referre them unto the Creator. So this difference or plurality of attributes in God, growes, firſt in regard of the weakeneſſe of our underſtanding; and ſecondly by that ſuperexcellency of the divine nature, whereby the underſtanding is ſo farre exceeded. Therefore although our underſtanding bee no way able to compare all theſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall perfections of goodneſſe, power, wiſdome, &amp;c. together; and then to conceive them as one, but onely in one: yet our undertakings how ever wandring, or unable to conceive them as one infinite being, can
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:107656:40"/>no way make any difference or otherneſſe in them, or put any thing to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and ſimplicity thereof; but muſt acknowledge the more pure the being is, the more powerfull; and therefore by one only action of that ſimplicity, and one manner of working, doth it bring forth moſt different and manifold effects, both of the object, and in the object or matier whereon it workes.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Secondly it may be objected, that the ſimplicity is more where there is no diſtinction, than where there is. But in the Godhead there is diſtinction of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Therefore it may ſeeme his being is not moſt ſimple. I anſwer. That the diſtinction is not made in the nature or being of the Godhead, which thing only takes away ſimplicity; but only in the reall relations, in which the being is ſtill one and the ſame in all. And although the relations be truly and really diſtinct: yet that reall diſtinction, or diſtinct realitie is but only relative, and not bringing in any other being than is in the Godhead, underſtood without theſe relations, but only imports the order or manner of being.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Thirdly, it may bee objected, that every thing that is, muſt participate of being that it may bee, and of ſome other thing, that it may be ſomething, or a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in itſelfe, diſtinct from other beings. So God by his being is; and by his greatneſſe, and power, He is infinite, and almighty. Therefore it may ſeeme, his being is not ſimple. I ſay the propoſition is true onely in things that are by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation. But God is abſolutely of himſelfe, not by participation; and that abſolute and ſimple being of His, is of it ſelfe eſſentially infinite, and almighty, and not by participation, as was ſhewed, <hi>chap.</hi> 8. <hi>ante.</hi> in the anſwer, to the firſt objection.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Moſt neceſſary truth, and needing ſufficient proofe, not onely for the cleering of that which hath beene ſpoken; but eſpecially for laying the ſure ground-worke of that which is to follow concerning the Trinity. Therefore lend me the eare of your underſtanding that we may goe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in a matter of ſuch weight; And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the word <hi>worke</hi> in our common Engliſh, in which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſpeake, is growne to meane almoſt onely bodily toyle; yet you know there is the working of the minde alſo, and according to the things ſpoken of, you are bound either in your wit, or honeſty, ever to be as gentle as you can in the meaning of words, and to take them according to their greateſt fitneſſe. But firſt (you will ſay) it ought to appeare that God doth worke. For as <hi>Epicurus</hi> thought, He neither troubles himſelfe with any care or buſineſſe of his owne, neither yet is troublous to any other; or mindes what they doe, or ſay. For if ſo: then (as he ſuppoſed) He cannot in any wiſe be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, that hath ſo many things to thinke of. But againſt this thicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skin lazy opinion of <hi>Epicurus</hi> it ſhall appeare, that this working or
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:107656:40"/>Action of God is his endleſſe glory. But you muſt underſtand that this worke whereof I ſpeake, is not meant of that, whereby the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of God are manifeſted without in the creature; but of that which is in himſelfe alone. And that he doth worke is moſt plaine.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. For as an infinite action cannot be without an infinite power, ſo an infinite reſting cannot bee but either with an infinite unable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or want of skill, or infinite unwillingneſſe to worke; but an infinite unableneſſe cannot ſtand with an infinite power, nor want of skill with infinite wiſdome, nor unwillingneſſe with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite will. And it was proved before, that the power, wiſdome, and will of God are infinite; therefore he worketh alſo infinitelie: but if the reſting be not infinite, but ſuppoſed to be ſlackneſſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, or by turnes, becauſe of wearineſſe; that cannot ſtand with an infinite power, nor with the ſimplicitie of the divine being: for wearineſſe cannot befall but to ſuch a being onely as hath heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of parts: but in God is neither heavineſſe nor parts. And ſo He workes, and that infinitely.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. God is infinite, and ſo evermore as great as be may be, and that not in being only, but alſo in working: for otherwiſe greaterneſſe and leſneſſe ſhould be in him. And becauſe nothing can be in him, beſide His very being: if the infinitie of greatneſſe were in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a leſneſſe in his working, greaterneſſe and leſneſſe ſhould bee his very being; ſo finite and infinite, perfection and want, good and ill, ſhould be convertible in him: but theſe things are impoſſible. Therefore God doth either worke infinitely, or elſe he cannot worke at all; but ſo ſhould he not be worthy to be God, ſo ſhould not his power be infinite: and if his power be infinite and yet he cannot worke at all, then ſhould his power bee altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in vaine. But all theſe things are impoſſible, therefore God doth worke, and that infinitely.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The wiſdome of God is infinite, as was proved, and by the infinitie of his wiſdome hee doth underſtand the infinitie of his owne being; but that cannot be but by an infinite action of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: therefore the working of Gods wiſdome is infinite. And as theſe reaſons againſt <hi>Epicurus,</hi> that God doth worke and that infinitely; ſo alſo theſe that follow prove the queſtion fullie: for if the being of God be one, and that moſt ſimple, and that nothing can be in him but eſſentially, as was proved <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. <hi>§</hi> 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. if hee worke as is ſhewed, then his working or action muſt be his very being; which becauſe it is proved to be infinite, it muſt follow, that his action is alſo infinite.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The working of infinite goodneſſe, wiſdome, power, life, truth, &amp;c. in eternitie is the moſt deſtreable thing that may be, and wherein the greateſt glorie can conſiſt; which action of God, if by his will He would not; then muſt be will a ceaſing of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of goodneſſe, wiſdome, power, &amp;c. and that in eternitie. So ſhoudl theſe dignities be infinite invaine, ſo his will were not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:107656:41"/>to the reſt of his dignities, ſo ſhould hee not will the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of his owne glorie, nor being. But all theſe things are impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: therefore the working of his dignities are anſwerable to their being; and therefore infinite.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. The power of God is infinite, as was proved; by which infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of power, all the other dignities of God, may both be and worke infinitely. And if the goodneſſe and other dignities of God did not worke infinitely when by his power they might; there ſhould be an inequalitie or want in his goodneſſe, which ſhould not be anſwerable to his power; and the deprivation of the working of an infinite goodneſſe, would enforce an infinite ill, ſo God ſhould ceaſe to be infinitely good. But all theſe things are impoſſible. Therefore the action of Gods goodneſſe, is of neceſſitie infinite.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. The power of God is ſuch, as that hee is thereby enabled to worke, and if by his infinity, he were not able to worke infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie; then his infinitie ſhould be of leſſe force to withſtand littleneſſe and not being; than his power is to withſtand weakeneſſe: ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and want ſhould be in his infinitie, which of all his other dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities is ſet moſt againſt it, and ſo his power ſhould be infinite one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in the poſſibilitie of working, but finite in the action. But theſe things are impoſſible: therefore the power of God is as infinite in the working as it is in the being.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. If the working of God were not infinite, he could not know it to be infinite, but finite onely and in defect: but <hi rend="sup">a</hi> God cannot know any defect in himſelfe, in whom no defect is poſſible to be; Therefore his working is infinite.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. If infinite working and being be not all one in God, then there muſt of neceſſitie be in him, either a multiplicitie of being, or of accidents, or of being and accidents. But all theſe things have been ſhewed to be impoſſible: <hi>chap</hi> 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9. therefore infinite being and working are in God all one. So then his working is infinite.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. An infinite glory cannot be without the conditions of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and eternitie; nor yet without the being of goodneſſe: but neither can it be ſaid to have the being of goodneſſe, if it ſpread not it ſelfe in the action of goodneſſe; neither yet of infinite and eternall goodneſſe, if it worke not infinitely and eternally: but the glory of God is infinite, with all the conditions of infinitie, eternitie and goodneſſe. Therefore it workes infinitely and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, according to the being of infinite and eternall goodneſſe.</p>
                        <p n="10">10 The truth of God was proved to be infinite and one: but if in the divine dignities there be a greatneſſe in being and a leſneſſe in working; the truth in God muſt likewiſe be divers and not one, ſo neither ſimple nor infinite. But this is impoſſible: therefore the working of his dignities is infinite as his being.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. The infinitie of God is ſuch, that <hi rend="sup">b</hi> no abatement, want or leſneſſe may be underſtood or found therein: but littleneſſe or
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:107656:41"/>abatement might bee found therein, if it were not as great in the action thereof, as in the being: for every abatement or want, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it bee of the being, or of the working, in goodneſſe, power, wiſdome, &amp;c. is not onely a leſſening, but even an utter taking away of the infinitie thereof. So that to denie the infinite wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of God, is to denie his infinitie, and ſo his being.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. If all the dignities of God be infinite both in being and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, it will follow that their equalitie and concord one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, is alſo infinite; ſo that they be eſſentially one God, and the ſame convertibly one with another, the reſpects onely different as hath beene ſhewed <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. <hi>note (h) ob.</hi> 1. But if theſe dignities bee not infinite in working, as they are in being, the diſagreement will bee infinite: becauſe betweene no working or a finite working, and a being every way infinite, there is an infinite diſtance; and to put this diſtance in God, whoſe being is moſt ſimple and one, would be utterlie impoſſible: therefore God is altogether infinite in being and working. If further proofe ſeeme yet needfull, you may take hereto an inducement or two.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. The underſtanding of man is the image of God in him, and as the underſtanding will not reſt: ſo is it much more meet to thinke of an endleſſe wiſdome. Nay the very fantaſie or thought though bodily, though tyed to the five outward wits alone, yet will it not reſt: and when it cannot worke upon the reaſon, as in ſleepe (becauſe reaſon will ſee that the fantaſie was not deceiued in the outward ſences) then will it preſſe upon the remembrance, as it appeares in dreames.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. If Hee which is cauſe of all working ſhould ceaſe to worke, then all things at once ſhould ceaſe alſo both to worke and to be, becauſe <hi rend="sup">c</hi> the firſt mover ceaſing to move, all the enſuing motion muſt be at a ſtand. And if his power and the working thereof up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the creature did ceaſe; as the creature by his power was raiſed from nothing, ſo would it returne to nothing, if by the ſame it were not continually upheld. Therfore God doth worke continually, and as the worker is infinite, <hi rend="sup">d</hi> ſo is his working infinitely.</p>

I <hi>anſwer,</hi> that motion and operation or working are very different; theſe are like to motions, but neither are motions, nor yet with motions: for to feele, to ſee, to underſtand, to will, or any other action immanent or dwelling in the worker, are actions, operations or workings of the ſences, the underſtanding and will: but yet no motions, but moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly, and onely in likeneſſe: for all working, action, or operation, is of a thing that is in perfection; but motion properly ſo called, is alwayes with imperfection, and leaves the thing wherein the motion is, in poſſibilitie one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a further perfection. And yet the very moving from place to place may be an example of this working, which I have proved in God to be infinite. For if you ſet a ruler upon a pin, and turne it with violence upon that centre, you ſhall perceive no part of the ſurface ouer which it is turned, which you ſhall not ſee covered every where with the ruler, and the ſwifter it is carried about, the better and more cloſely doth it cover it: ſo that if you ſuppoſe that motion to be infinite in ſwiftneſſe, with continuance for a certaine time, then every part of the ruler in the continuall ſucceſſion of that time, muſt of neceſſity be eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where upon the under ſurface, according to the length of that time, which the ruler doth make from the navell point to the hemme or circumference. So that you cannot more rightly call it motion than reſt, when every part of the ruler is continually upon every part of the ſurface under it. And even ſo this working which I have proved to be in the Godhead, becauſe it is infinite, may moſt truly according to this example be called reſt; becauſe his owne action in himſelfe is that wherein above all other he can take moſt glorie and delight; as being in the perfection of goodneſſe, power, wiſdome, truth and glorie, &amp;c. And thus according to the meaſure of our weake underſtanding, having conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what God is in his being, it followes that we enquire alſo, what Hee is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the manner of his being.</p>

But as yet how farre wee are from thence, every man doth ſufficiently know. For is there any Dyer ſo overweening in his craft of dying, as that he dare take upon him to know all the poſſibilities that are in the mixing and ſetting of colours? nay in the ſervice of that great god of our pampered gurmandizers, I meane the belly, is there any Cooke, that will take upon him to bee able to make all thoſe very things which are day lie ſought out to pleaſe the taſte? if then in thoſe things wherein our ſences are moſt delighted, wherein we ſtudie with greedines how to pleaſe our ſelves, we muſt confeſſe our dulneſſe; how much more heavie muſt we needs be in that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of neither our ſences, nor our reaſon, nor the higheſt and beſt part of our underſtanding, all Nature helping us herein, can give us any knowledge? Who knowes the thoughts of a man, but the ſpirit of a man that is within him? how much more then is it impoſſible to know the myſteries of God, but by that relation which hee hath made unto us of himſelfe? Therefore the knowledge of that my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of the holy Trinitie in the Unitie of the Godhead, is that ſuperexcellencie of knowledge, which we have by the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture onely; which truth we are ſo much the more carefull to know, and conſtantlie to uphold: firſt becauſe it concernes that moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and high being, even of God himſelfe; ſecondly, becauſe the revelation thereof is from God alone, manifeſted by his word; thirdly, becauſe it is the foundation of our faith and hope: for if Chriſt our Saviour be not very God, and very man; the being of our Mediatour, and the alſufficiencie of his merit is utterly vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed; fourthlie, it is one of the maine and principall differences between our moſt high Religion taught us by God himſelfe, and the falſe worſhip of Idolaters, of the <hi>Iewes, Turkes, Arians,</hi> and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:107656:43"/>other hereticks, which from time to time have turned the truth of God into a lye. Fifthlie, we follow herein the holy Martyrs and the Fathers in the primitive Church, and thoſe Councells which have from time to time maintained this truth againſt all hereſies.</p>
                           <p>And although it cannot bee denied, but that even among the Heathens, ſome of their wiſeſt, both Poets and Philoſophers knew this myſterie by heare-ſay, as they had received it from the <hi>Hebrewes;</hi> as you may reade in <hi>Thom.

This glorious truth then being plainely diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to us in the New Teſtament; let us ſee with what diligence and faithfulneſſe, reaſon that ſervant of God doth wait on the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of his Lord, and how thereby <hi>(a)</hi> wee are ſummoned to hearken unto this truth: for although reaſon could never have found it out; yet being taught what the truth of God is herein, it joyes to ſee the neceſſitie of that truth which it is bound to beleeve.</p>
                           <p>But becauſe I have written ſomewhat to this Argument already (which that you miſſe not, I have cauſed to bee printed at the end of this booke) I may be ſomewhat more briefe herein.

Of this (through his helpe) we ſhall ſpeake hereafter <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. but firſt of the firſt perſon of the holie Trinitie. The Greeke Churches by the authoritie of

A Perſon then of the holy Trinitie is an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable ſubſiſtence in the Divine nature. Theſe words have their ground in the holy Scripture, to which in this great Article of our faith wee muſt ever have recourſe, by reaſon of the many and ſtrong hereſies that have beene thereabout. <hi>Trinitie, Triuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> or a threefold being in one, hath ground in that Text which is in <hi>Matthew</hi> 28.19. <hi>Goe teach all Nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> But certaine it is, that in our Baptiſme, wee bind our faith and allegiance unto God alone.

                              </gap>, which is different from ſubſtance, nature, being, or the like termes that ſignifie any common, or univerſall being: for an <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> meanes a peculiar being wherein the common na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is wholly and entyre, as I ſaid before, and will ſay untill you underſtand mee. For example, the whole nature or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of man is underſtood in that word <hi>Man,</hi> and ſo the Angelicall nature in that word <hi>Angell;</hi> but <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Gabriel</hi> meane that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon, in which the common being is whole and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre.

The being or eſſence of the Godhead is one individuall, moſt ſimplie, abſolutelie, and ſubſtantiallie one; which infinite and undivideable being of the Godhead is yet nevertheleſſe in everie Perſon entyre and wholly, ſo that nothing of the eſſentiall being of the Godhead is in one, which is not in the other.

Being is that which is common to all things that are. The word <hi>Subſtance,</hi> properlie doth not ſo much import the verie inward being, as that reſpect which it hath to the accidents
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:107656:44"/>that are therein. <hi>Subſiſtence,</hi> ſignifies that ſpeciall manner of being which belongs to ſubſtances that are actually being.

                           <p>Now the name of a <hi>Father,</hi> is moſt poperly given unto God the firſt Perſon of the Trinitie (for of him is <gap reason="foreign">

And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that this action of the Godhead, in the bringing forth, or eternall generation of the Sonne, is onely in the eſſentiall being of the Deitie eternally: therefore it is not an action of God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding meerely from the freedome of His will, as it is ſaid of the creature, <hi>Revel.</hi> 4.11. That for his will ſake onely they are and were created. For all ſuch actions are exerciſed onely in things of themſelves meerely not being; in which God hath power to will; or not to will their being: but becauſe that God doth worke accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the perfection of his moſt excellent being, as <hi>Prov. chap.</hi> 10. So glorious and powerfull an action in himſelfe, cannot be in vaine; therefore it is neceſſarie that the product, effect, or object of that action, which is the Sonne, be every way anſwerable to that action in the infinitie of glory, wiſdome, power, &amp;c.

But in things wherein there is an abſolute freedome of the will, one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there muſt a choice bee poſſible, which cannot bee but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene two at leaſt: which not onelie an infinite will doth utterly exclude; but even that naturall will alſo, whereby every thing workes according to the inclination or propriety of the kinde. So then neither can God in the infinitie of his will, but will that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which is the image of himſelfe, the beſt of beings, infinite in
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:107656:44"/>goodneſſe and in glory: Neither can He but worke according to the perfection of his being, for the production of that which Hee doth will. As all our naturall ſences inward and outward worke willingly, yet neceſſarily; that is, according to their naturall being, upon their proper obiect. For the Eye is not ſatisfied with ſeeing, nor the eare with hearing.</p>
                           <p>Now is it yet further to bee remembred, that although there be an infinite and eternall production of the Perſons in the deity; yet there is no bringing forth, or multiplication of any new being. For the Godhead being eternall, it is not poſſible that any new God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head ſhould bee brought forth. Neither yet can any addition bee made thereto: becauſe it is infinite. And ſo you may conclude of all thoſe dignities or perfections of the Godhead, as wiſdome, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, glory, goodneſſe, &amp;c. Yet ſeeing goodneſſe doth ever move that which is good to multiply the image of it ſelfe; and power joyned therewith, inableth goodneſſe to worke; and infinity with them cauſeth goodneſſe and power both to be, and to worke infinitely: therfore it is neceſſary that in the Godhead there be an eternall mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication or production, of thoſe true and reall diſtinct relations, which we call Perſons. So that although goodneſſe, power, infinity, &amp; all the other glorious dignities which are in God, be one infinite being; one onely in the moſt ſimple, pure, and perfect agreement or concord of being; yet theſe relations muſt bee diſtinct, in ſuch cleare difference; that that one cannot poſſibly bee that other from which it is really and truely diſtinguiſhed, though in eſſence or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they be all one infinity. <hi rend="sup">c</hi> As in the being of goodneſſe there is an infinite producer, or bringeth forth of goodneſſe, which is the Father; an infinite goodneſſe brought forth, which is the Sonne: and an infinite production or bringing forth of goodneſſe: which could not be, if either the efficient, or bringer forth of goodneſſe, or the goodneſſe brought forth were not. For where either the agent, or the object is wanting, it is impoſſible that any action at all ſhould be. And therefore as the Sonne proceeds from the Father; So the holy Ghoſt is moſt rightly ſaid to proceed from the Father, and the Sonne. And this is the diſtinction of the perſons, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their originall or proceſſion. But becauſe all theſe are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and that in the infinitie of being, and working, there muſt needs be eternity; therefore there can bee no beforeneſſe nor after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, nor ceaſing either to bee, or to worke. And therefore is none of theſe Perſons before, or after another, but all three diſtinct Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are one infinite, and eternall deity.</p>

                              <p>§ 3. 1. If God bee infinite in his working, as He is in his being, then hee muſt needs worke to bring forth ſuch as himſelfe is, and that both infinitely and eternally, anſwerable to his being; and this
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:107656:45"/>in the Godhead alone, ſeeing that beſide it, nothing can be infinite and eternall. But it is ſufficiently proved in the 10. <hi>chap.</hi> That God is infinite in his working, as hee is in his being. Therefore by his infinite working, He brings forth ſuch as Himſelfe is. And by theſe three termes you ſee the holy Trinity expreſſed and proved. 1. God infinite, the Father. 2. That which he worketh, the Sonne; The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite working it ſelfe, which combineth both together, the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. Neither can power be infinite, nor infinity powerfull, if there bee not ſuch an agreement betweene them, that they may toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther both be and worke infinitely. But if they bee and worke infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely, it is neceſſary that there bee a production in the Godhead: For otherwiſe that infinite worke ſhould be in vaine, and not pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull to produce the like. But that is impoſſible; therefore there is a production in the Godhead.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. If there be not a production of Perſons in the Godhead (as is before ſpoken:) then an infinite goodneſſe is not a bringer forth of goodneſſe, and ſo followes a privation or ceaſing in the working of goodneſſe, which brings on, either a diſability in the power, or a want in the will, or in the wiſdome of the worker: which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand with his infinity of power, will, and wiſdome, of whom we ſpeake. Beſides, ſeeing in Him, to be, and to worke are all one, (as was ſhewed) hee that denies the infinity, and eternity of his working, denies alſo the infinity and eternity of his being. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing all theſe things are falſe, and impoſſible; it followes of neceſſity, that there is a production of Perſons in the oneneſſe of the Godhead. Or take it thus affirmatively.</p>
                              <p n="4">4. That goodneſſe is truely a great goodneſſe, which doth bring forth a great good; and by how much more it brings forth a greater good, by ſo much more it comes neerer to infinitie. <hi rend="sup">d</hi> Therefore God in whom infinity and goodneſſe are one being, doth bring forth eternally an infinite good, that is, the Sonne, betwixt whom and himſelfe reſults an infinite Communion of goodneſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the holy Ghoſt.</p>
                              <p>If there muſt needs bee a diſtinction of termes in the actions of the Godhead, then there muſt needs bee a difference of Perſons; otherwiſe the difference of the termes were idle and vaine, if the being underſtood thereby were not anſwerable. But there muſt needs bee a diſtinction of termes in the working of the Godhead. For an infinite working (already proved) muſt needs be from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite worker, about an infinite worke. Therefore there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Perſons in the unity of the deity.</p>
                              <p n="6">6. If there were not an infinite and eternall production in the Perſons of the Godhead; then the being of a beginning could not cleerely and evidently bee therein; becauſe though the beginner were; yet the working of the beginner, and the being begun were yet wanting: and ſo theſe two comming after ſhould bee inferiour
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:107656:45"/>or leſſe both in continuance, and infinitie. And ſo the firſt and higheſt cauſe ſhould bee an infinite beginner without any effect or thing begun by him, which muſt bring on, that the firſt and chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt cauſe of all, ſhould be infinitely defective, and ceaſing to worke: and of leſſe force than other cauſes ſubordinate; which all worke inceſſantlie to the bringing forth of their effects, unleſſe they bee hindered by lets more powerfull. Therefore there bee moe Perſons than one in the unitie of the Godhead.</p>
                              <p n="7">7. Being and the power of Being; working and the power of working are all one in God, as was ſhewed <hi>chap.</hi> 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9. <hi>n.</hi> 6. But God by his infinite and eternall power, can bring forth an infinite and eternall being like Himſelfe, by the infinite and eternall working of his power. Therefore He doth bring forth: or if he can, and will not, that power were in vaine; and ſo his power and will were not equall and infinite. So there ſhould bee divers beings in God, finite and infinite. But all theſe things are impoſſible. Therefore God doth bring forth an infinite being, his Sonne, by his infinite wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, the holy Ghoſt.</p>
                              <p n="8">8. If the inward working of the deity bee infinite with all the conditions of Infinitie; then the underſtanding of God (for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample) muſt bee infinite, both in the act or perfection of it ſelfe; and in the object which it doth underſtand, and in the worke or action of the underſtanding about that object. So that God under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his owne being, muſt needs behold himſelfe by an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite action of underſtanding. But the working of God is infinite, with all the conditions of infinitie, as hath beene proved, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there ſhould bee a greaterneſſe in being, and a leſſeneſſe in working; and ſo the being of God ſhould not bee ſimple and one. Therefore in the unity of the infinite deity, there is an infinite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, which we call the Father, an infinite object, or image of that underſtanding, in the ſight of which that infinite under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is moſt delighted, becauſe nothing can be more excellent than it; and this is God underſtood, that glorious Sonne: and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite working of the underſtanding, and that is the Holy Ghoſt: which you ſee cannot be conceived to be; if either the infinite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, or the object were ſuppoſed not to be; and therefore he is ſaid to proceed from them both. And thus is it in all the other dignities of God; his goodneſſe, his infinitie, his eternity, power, will, truth, glory, &amp;c.</p>
                              <p n="9">9. Now the texts whereby this doctrine is taught, more darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the old Teſtament, leſt the true Church, with the Heathen, might have fallen into the opinion of many Gods, are theſe among many other. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 26. <hi>Let us make man in our owne image. &amp; Gen.</hi> 3.22. <hi>Behold the man is become as one of us. Gen.</hi> 11.7. <hi>Let us goe downe; and let us confound their language, Gen.</hi> 11.7. which manner of ſpeech is not borrowed for manners ſake, from the cuſtome of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and great men; who for modeſtie, ſpeake not in their owne
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:107656:46"/>name alone <hi>(Wee)</hi> but as having determined with their great men, and counſellors, men like themſelves. But God doth not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult nor determine by advice of his Creature; Neither yet doth that language admit ſuch forme of ſpeech; but as the Eaſterne lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages even to this day ſpeake to one particular perſon in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of one: as you may reade. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Thou art the man. and</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18 3. <hi>Thou ſhalt not goe forth.

You have a like proofe in <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.24.5.6. where the word <hi>Iehovah</hi> is three times repeated in the bleſſing and every time with a ſeverall accent. So that although his name be one. <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.9. and his being one. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.4. yet in that one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is a Trinitie of Perſons; which you ſhall better underſtand, if you conſider the bleſſings in the new Teſtament, all taken from hence, as that. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.14. <hi>&amp; Rev.</hi> 1.4.5. &amp;c. So likewiſe in <hi>Iob.</hi> 35.10. <hi>Where is God my makers? and Pſal.</hi> 149. <hi>Let Iſrael rejoyce in his makers.

                              <hi>(a) BY reaſon we are ſummon'd to hearken to this truth. [Pref.] Tho. Aqu.</hi> in his queſtions on the maſter of the ſentences. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Diſt.</hi> 2. <hi>q.</hi> 3. brings a couple of reaſons to prove a plurality of Perſons in the unity of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, which in effect are theſe. 1. with the greateſt happineſſe there muſt bee the greateſt pleaſure and content. But in the Poſſeſſion of that which is good, there cannot be pleaſure and content without company, ſeeing the perfection of every good thing ſtands in the community of the uſe thereof. But com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany is not without plurality. The ſecond reaſon is from the perfection of the divine love: and all love ever wiſhes well to another. But theſe reaſons prove no more a Trinity than a ſociety of Ten; and ſit better for an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, than the high myſtery in queſtion. And therefore having look't well upon his reaſons, and ſeeing that they were very poore inductions; he reſolves, it is no way neceſſary to put a diſtinction of Perſons in the Deity for the force of reaſons; but onely for the juſtifying of our Faith, and for the authority of the Holy Scriptures. And in the third <hi>Diſc. qu.</hi> 4. whether it were poſſible for the old Philoſophers, which knew not the Scripture, by the knowledge of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture onely to come to the knowledge of the Trinity; hee ſaith, that by the view of the creature they might come to the knowledge of the divine power, wiſdome, and goodneſſe, as the cauſe is manifeſt by the effect; and conclude that there is one God, even as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> proves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. and againe. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.18.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:107656:47"/>out of the 19. Pſalme: But that they could not thereby attaine the knowledge of the Trinity; becauſe the Creature was an inſufficient meanes, to bring them to the knowledge of that high myſterie. So in the 4 booke of his <hi>Summe Contr. Gentiles. Cap.</hi> 1. hee determines even ſo concerning the incarnation, and the conſequents thereof. So likewiſe concerning the reſurrection, everlaſting life and all our hopes that depend thereon. Againe in his <hi>Summe</hi> of <hi>Theologie,</hi> chap. 33. hee concludes that by naturall reaſon it is impoſſible to know God in the diſtinction of Perſons: and that for theſe reaſons. 1. Firſt it takes away from the worthineſſe of our Faith. 2. Faith is of things not appearing, and ſuch as exceed reaſon, as it is ſaid. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. Thirdly, Infidels laugh at that which is not fully proved: and therefore (ſaith hee) it ſhall bee ſufficient to defend, that our faith holds nothing that is impoſſible. But (Doctor) reaſon muſt yeeld that to bee impoſſible which it cannot make to appeare that it is poſſible. And therefore that our faith bee not ſet at nought by misbeleevers, as being of things impoſſible, you tye us for defence thereof to further proofe: which if it be full and ſufficient, your third reaſon is nothing worth. The firſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is leſſe worth in it ſelfe: For that is the glory of a Chriſtian faith, and the triumph of it over all falſe worſhips, that is ſo ſurely founded in the truth of God, that the Gates of hell cannot prevaile againſt it. Therefore to ſpeake cleerely to this queſtion, I ſay, the word <hi>naturall reaſon,</hi> may either meane that reaſon whereof a man is capable by that light of underſtanding which is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally through the gift of Chriſt in every man, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.4.9. the holy Scripture hath opened this light moſt clearely, and therefore is it called the light of Grace; or elſe it may meane ſuch reaſons, as are gathered from the cauſes, effects and rules which are manifeſt onely in naturall things. Now although the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of our creede by way of Induction onely may be manifeſt by naturall reaſon thus underſtood, as S. <hi>Auguſtine de Civit. Dei. lib.</hi> 11. <hi>cap.</hi> 26. in this very que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion hath made it appeare; yet by that firſt light of underſtanding, which wee call naturall reaſon, becauſe it is in every man according to the poſſibility of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they may bee underſtood and approved by other rules, than ſuch as have their grounds in naturall things. For God is not the God of nature onely; but much more the God of grace; and mercy; and to the knowledge of theſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and the concluſions gathered thereon, wee are led by better guides than <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ever knew; that is, the holy Scripture, and the Spirit of Grace, who leades us to the right meaning thereof. Yet how farre even Naturall light hath gone in the diſcovery of the great Myſteries of Divinity, even of the Trinity it ſelfe, you may judge by this of <hi>Proclus</hi> taken out of <hi>Plato,</hi> as you may reade in <hi>Steuchus de perenni phi. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 16. Theſe two (ſaith hee) unity and Being, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in the Trinity; the firſt begetting, the ſecond begotten; the one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting, the other perfected: it muſt needs be, that there is a certaine power, by the which, and with the which that unity gives ſubſiſtence and perfection unto that being. <q>For both the proceſſion from that unity to being, and the returne from that being unto unity, muſt be by a middle power betweene them both. For how can unity bee Being, or Being bee one, but by that power which is in both? And this Trinity is the excellency of all underſtanding, unity, power, Being, the one bringing forth, the other brought forth, and power proceeding from unity ioyned with being. And this is the firſt Trinitie that can bee underſtood, or conceived to bee; unity, being, and the power of them both, by which, divinity is the Father of being, &amp; being is of unity. The Father is the father of wiſdome; and wiſdome the Son of the Father; and between theſe a moſt high power hidden, in the one of producing, in the other of being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, as <hi>Plato</hi> hath ſhewed it wonderfully.</q> Thus <hi>Proclus.</hi> The argument of <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi> is not of leſſe weight. That which is unchangeable muſt needs be eternal, and alwayes one. And as al change in every body is by reaſon of inequality of the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:107656:47"/>parts: ſo that which is abſolutely and ever one, muſt be ever in equality, ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and equalitie muſt be eternall: and multiplicity and inequality muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily bee after unity and equalitie. And as unity is the cauſe of connexion, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one, ſo inequality is of diviſion. And the effect of the firſt cauſe muſt have priority before the effects of the ſecond cauſe. Therefore connexion alſo muſt be before diviſion and change: and if before change, then alſo eternall. And becauſe there can bee but one eternall: therefore unity, equality, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion, muſt bee one thing. And this is that threefold unity which <hi>Pythagoras</hi> taught was to bee adored. <hi>Pet. Blondus de Trenario. pag.</hi> 106.107. And <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa de Docta ignorantia. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. Neither is that reaſon which <hi>Cuſa Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eroit. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>pag.</hi> 134. brings from <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> to bee ſlighted; eſpecially by <hi>Thomas,</hi> that great <hi>Ariſtotelian. Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, that the firſt cauſe of all muſt needs be both efficient, formall, and the end. And three firſts there cannot be; becauſe before all plurality there muſt needs be unity. Therefore it being one firſt, it muſt bee a threefold cauſe; efficient, formall, and finall. The efficient cauſe is neither Formall, nor Finall; and the formall is neither finall, nor efficient. Therefore they are three diſtinct cauſes conſidered in their ſeverall ſubſiſtences: but conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in their firſtneſſe, they are in being one alone: many ſuch reaſons and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities to this purpoſe you may reade in <hi>Struchus Deperenni Phi. lib.</hi> 1. &amp; 2. But how much yet more fitly, and more fully, hath the illuminated <hi>Raimund,</hi> ſhewed both this point and all thoſe other, which <hi>Tho. Aqu.</hi> hath given over as paſt all proofe? For <hi>Raimund</hi> taking all thoſe conditions of the divine being, which the holy Scripture gives to God; and without which that being could not be perfect: and ſuppoſing and proving them to be infinite with all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of infinity, both in being and working; hath taught the way to ſhew the Trinity of Perſons in unity of being, by every one of thoſe conditions, ſee <hi>Art. mag. Part.</hi> 9. And though his words ſeeme borrel and rude; as <hi>bonificans, bonificabile, &amp; Bonificare, in una bonitatis eſſentia; Poſſificans, poſſificabile, and poſſifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care</hi> in the being of power: yet they are full of excellent meaning. The learned, and witty <hi>Cuſa de viſione Dei cap.</hi> 17. gives inſtance in the unity: which is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unity uniting, unity united, or the union, or knot of them both: yet all theſe in the moſt ſimple being of unity. And againe in love, which is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Perſon loving, or in the Perſon loved, or in the knot of the Love betweene them, all according in the nature of Love; and without any of theſe, Love cannot be perfect and compleate, yet may every one of theſe be underſtood apart; inaſmuch as a man may love, and not be loved; loved, and not love a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. But where that which is Lovely, is alſo loving, there the bond of love is firmely tyed, and love in every part entire: yet is this love but in ſhadowes among us, but perfect in the endleſſe and perfect being of love. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.8.16. And thus in other conditions of the divine nature have other learned and devout men endevoured to ſhew their underſtanding and firme conſent unto this high article of the chriſtian Faith: one in the power of God; another in his wiſdome, &amp;c. according to the proofes you read before. And therefore, not to goe about to overthrow the reaſons brought by <hi>Thomas;</hi> becauſe the authority of ſo great a Doctor may cut deeper than his reaſons, and ſo cut off, if not the ſtrength of the reaſons in the articles following; yet that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort which the faithfull ſoule might have thereby. I ſay that all the reaſons which are brought to this article, and ſo for the moſt part in all the reſt, are onely of two kindes. Firſt and chiefely from the impoſſibilities which would follow upon the contradiction of the thing in queſtion: which kinde of diſcourſe I have taught (as I can) <hi>log. cap.</hi> 8. <hi>n.</hi> 7. and <hi>chap.</hi> 26. more at large. Secondly, by that kinde of demonſtration, which I call by converſion of termes, as I ſhewed, <hi>log. cap.</hi> 18. <hi>n.</hi> 3. in the ſyllogiſticall handling of ſuch arguments, as in effect are all one with them which <hi>log. cap.</hi> 13. <hi>n.</hi> 5. I ſhewed
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:107656:48"/>to bee by rule, in the ſecond kinde of equivalence. Now both theſe kindes of argument prove the queſtion onely that it is; that is to ſay, ſhew onely that the propoſition is true, and neither prove nor enquire how, or for what ſuperiour cauſe, which in this and in many of the other queſtions here handled cannot be given. And there is no propoſition, how true, how univerſall, or manifeſt ſoever, but it may be proved by theſe meanes, both in the affirmative; For in things of the ſame nature, and being, whatſoever agrees to one, muſt needs agree to the other; and in the negative, the ground of impoſſibilities and all negative diſcourſe, whatſoever is denied to the predicate, muſt alſo bee denyed to the ſubject. Now I thinke it is no more derogation from the truth to bee thus confirmed, than it is, ſimplie to bee affirmed, as it is in the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Creed. As if I ſay, there is an eternall being, the cauſe of all Beings: there is an infinite wiſdome the diſpoſer of all: an infinite power that governes all, and thereupon conclude, that there is a God. What diſhonour is here of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to God or his truth? are not all theſe termes, an eternall Being, the cauſe of all beings? An infinite Wiſdome, &amp;c. convertible one with another? and all of them meaning one being, which wee call God? have they not all au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the Holy Scripture? And ſhall not that which is truely affirmed of one, bee as truely affirmed of the other? And ſo on the otherſide by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilities. If there bee not an eternall being, the beginner and cauſe of all other beings: then that which is begun muſt bee a beginning to it ſelfe. But this is impoſſible, for ſo it ſhould bee a cauſe, and yet not bee. Therefore there is a God. And if any other kinde of argument bee brought, either by rule, or induction, or ſyllogiſme, yet ſeeing ſuperiour cauſes are not alwayes here to bee found, whereby to make analyticall demonſtration; therefore the reaſons for the moſt part are contayned within this bound onely to prove the Article that it is true. Nay, I adde yet further, that the Theologian or divine is not ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the uſe of naturall reaſons onely for proofe of his concluſions. For ſo you ſhould make divinity nothing elſe but naturall Philoſophie, except that the one ſhould bee intended to the cauſe of all being, the other to the effect in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture onely; But you know that all truth whereinſoever it is, being founded in the truth of God, reaſon the ſearcher thereof muſt farre exceed the limits of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or naturall cauſes. Therefore although that concluſion of <hi>Tho. Aquin.</hi> ſtand ſure, that the philoſophers could not come to the knowledge of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity by the view of nature; becauſe nature was an inſufficient meane to bring them thereunto; which yet may receive limitation, either in reſpect of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of knowledge, which nature brings of the Creator as himſelfe makes diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, <hi>Prooem. in lib.</hi> 4. <hi>contr. gent.</hi> or in reſpect of the manner of concluding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive onely, yet will it not follow from thence, that the articles of our Faith are utterly beyond all proofe of reaſon. For as divinitie is of a farre higher ſtraine than naturall Philoſophie; ſo are the proofes and reaſons thereof, from greater lights than all nature can ſhew. Who knowes not that divinity as concerning a great part of the practice holds all morall Philoſophie, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions though from reaſon, yet are not the reaſons natural, but morall? Have not Grammar, Logick, and all other Artes and Sciences, either inſtrumentall or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall, certaine rules, or principles which are true, <gap reason="foreign">

And to this very purpoſe Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>De Civ. Dei. lib.</hi> 11. <hi>Cap.</hi> 24. <hi>Diligentia rationis eſt, non prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptionis audacia; ut in operibus Dei ſecreto quodam loquendi' modo, quo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra exerceatur intentio, intelligatur Trinitas.</hi> That is, the Holy Trinity may bee underſtood by us in the workes of God, by their ſecret manner of ſpeech, in which they ſpeake to our underſtanding. And if this high myſtery may bed underſtood by the creature, as the Father ſhewes in that booke, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:107656:48"/>other Chriſtian writers elſewhere, I doubt not but by thoſe honourable titles which the holy Scripture doth give unto God it may much better bee made to appeare. And if it were lawfull to prove the firſt and principall Article of our faith by reaſon, and by reaſon (I ſay) without preſumption of perfection in knowledge, to prove that God is, as it hath beene ſhewed by the warrant of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> is it not likewiſe as lawfull in the Articles following? And theſe things may ſeeme the more ſtrange in <hi>Thom. Aquin.</hi> becauſe in the 11. <hi>chap.</hi> of his fourth booke <hi>contra Gentiles,</hi> he doth ſo clearelie deliver this point of our beleefe, both by the authoritie of the holy Scriptures, and the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of reaſon, yea and that on the ſame grounds whereon <hi>Raymundus</hi> doctrine is builded, that he may ſeeme to have lighted his torch at the lampe of <hi>Thomas.</hi> Take the meaning of his words, as they lye. Seeing that in the Divine nature, He that underſtands, the action of his underſtanding, and his intention, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject underſtood, are all one and the ſame being; it muſt needs bee, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever belongs to the perfect being of any of theſe, be moſt truly in Him. Now it is eſſentiall to the inward word, or intention underſtood, that it do proceed from him that underſtands, according to the action of his underſtanding. And ſeeing that in God all theſe three are eſſentially one, (for in him nothing can be but eſſentiallie) it is neceſſarie that every one of theſe be God, and that the difference which is betweene them, bee not of being, but of relation onlie, or the manner of being, as the intention is referred to him that conceives it, as to him from whom it is: therefore the Evangeliſt having ſaid, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. <hi>The word was God,</hi> leſt all diſtinction might ſeeme to bee taken away betweene the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Sonne, addes immediately, <hi>That Word was in the beginning with God.</hi> Thus ſaith <hi>Thomas.</hi> Oh but (ſay you) it is a dangerous caſe to commit matters of faith to reaſon. I, but there is no danger to commit reaſon to matiers of faith, that is, to make reaſon a ſervant of faith, neither is our reaſon too good to give attendance on faith, nor faith ſo proud as to ſcorne the ſervice of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: therefore let this jangling and frowardneſſe ceaſe. If I ſay any thing to your content, accept it; if not, you are not bound to reade it: but God hath not given us the knowledge of himſelfe in his word, that as parrats in a cage, which with much adoe are taught a few words, and then can ſay no more; ſo we ſhould hold our ſelves content when wee can ſay the Creed: but that by continuall meditation in his word, our knowledge, and ſo our faith, our love and feare of him, might be increaſed dayly. And this is it which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Wee ſpeake wiſdome among them that are perfect,</hi> and againe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. <hi>The Grecians ſeeke wiſdome, and wee preach Chriſt the wiſdome of God: for in him are all the treaſures of wiſdome and knowledge hid.</hi> Now it is apparent that he meanes not the wiſdome of this world, but that which is in things concerning God, whereby we may be able to give a reaſon of the hope that is in us. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. And this is that perfection whereto we ought to ſtrive, whereof the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſme, doctrine of repentance, of faith, &amp;c. is but onely the foundation, as it is manifeſt. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1.2. For although the leaſt degree of faith, even as a graine of muſtard ſeed, bee ſufficient to remove the high mountaines of rebellious and wicked thoughts that riſe up againſt the obedience of the truth, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to ſave the ſoule, through his mediation and mercie that doth not breake the bruiſed reed, nor quench the ſmoking flaxe: yet ſeeing every man, as he hath received, ought as a faithfull Steward of the manifold graces of God to profit thereby; our hearts by faith being purged from dead workes, wee ought to adde vertue to our faith, and to this vertue knowledge, and by theſe meanes to make our calling and election ſure, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5.10. And for this cauſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> prayes for the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> that having through faith embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the truth, they might bee filled with knowledge of the will of God, in all wiſdome and ſpirituall underſtanding. And this is our progreſſe from faith
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:107656:49"/>to faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. that is from that pure faith, whereby wee firſt receive the kingdome of God as little children, to that faith, which is ſtrengthened through knowledge: for knowledge doth neither take away faith, nor yet abate any thing of the worthineſſe thereof; but rather encreaſeth it more and more, while it is thereby rooted and grounded more firmely in him, in whom at firſt we did beleeve, as the learned Father, <hi>Auguſt. de Trinit. Cap.</hi> 14. ſaid, <hi>Fides in nobis per ſcientiam gignitur, nutritur, defenditur, &amp; roboratur.</hi>

Pref.]</hi> While I was preparing materials for this building, I read the title of a Mart book, <hi>Abſtruſa abſtruſorum abſtruſiſſima, primaria Symboli Apoſtolici abſtruſa.</hi> Though I had beene more than once gul'd with ſuch titles, <hi>Arcana arcanorum arcaniſſima ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cana,</hi> and the like, wherein theſe writers ſweat more, than for any thing in the booke beſide: yet being interpreted, a pious and very profound meditation of the deepe myſteries of the Apoſtles Creed, I ſuppoſed that ſuch bumbaſt would never bee quilted into a treatiſe upon the grounds of our Religion; ſo that I verely hoped that all my labour was at an end. At laſt having got the booke, I found that it was nothing in good earneſt, but a declamation onely of a certaine ſpringal for exerciſe ſake, into which, as into a common place booke hee had gathered the ſentences of learned men, wherein they juſtlie bewaile the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of mankinde, in his inabilitie to finde out the truth of things, whereupon hee would utterlie ſhut out the uſe of reaſon in matiers of faith. The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is not good, as I have ſhewed <hi>Praef. n.</hi> 6. His ſpeciall ſpleene is againſt <hi>Keckerman</hi> and his <hi>gregales,</hi> that is, them of his <hi>ging,</hi> I thinke hee meanes the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> of whom hee names onely <hi>Zanchius,</hi> and them of whom he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this learning, <hi>Melancthon,</hi> and his owne verie <hi>Syren</hi> and <hi>Phaenix Scaliger;</hi> out of whoſe ſhreds hee hath botch't up his declamation, ſuch as it is, yet in this caſe he could not ſpare him, that would manifeſt his underſtanding of the Trinitie according to <hi>Raymunds</hi> principles. The wicked concluſion that will follow thereon, <hi>Murſhel</hi> the declamer goes about to ſhew out of <hi>Andreas Oſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander;</hi> as you ſhall heare anon, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. <hi>note (a).</hi> But what have <hi>Scaliger</hi> or <hi>Raymund</hi> done herein, which the ancient Fathers had not done before, ſave that they made the doctrine cleere by forreine compariſons? one, of the Sunne, the beame, and the brightneſſe or ſhine thereof; another by the body, the brightneſſe and heat of the fire; another of the minde, wherein is the word or underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereof, and the will: another ſaith, the minde thinking, the word repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting that thought, and the liking or approving thereof: yet another will repreſent the Trinitie by memorie, underſtanding and will: another by the root, the ſtem, and the branch. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſhewes it by a mans owne experience of himſelfe; who both is, and knowes himſelfe to bee, and loves both his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and knowledge thereof. <hi>de Civit. Dei. lib</hi> 11. <hi>cap.</hi> 26. But his reaſon in the 24. <hi>Chap. from Gen.</hi> 1. is of more force, which is this; He that ſaid, <hi>Fiat,</hi> muſt needs be the Father of that Word: but you muſt underſtand that word in Himſelfe, or that eternall word or decree, of which our Lord ſpeakes, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.19. And becauſe the creature was made thereby, it muſt follow, that it was made by his word. And where it is further ſaid, that all that was made was exceeding good; if by goodneſſe you underſtand the Holy Ghoſt, the whole Trinitie is manifeſted unto us in his workes: another explaines it by the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and the ſtreame; to which <hi>Cuſa</hi> addes the ſea, and if theſe (ſaith he) be ſuppoſed infinite, then muſt all of neceſſity be one water. And the ſame <hi>Cuſa
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:107656:49"/>lib. de Filiatione Dei.</hi> expreſſes it by the knowledge in the minde of the maſter; the word ſignifying that knowledge, and the ſpirit, life or meaning of the word proceeding from the knowledge, and the word, whereby the ſcholars are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed. And have not many of theſe compariſons ground in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Eſay</hi> 11.1. and elſe where? But <hi>Raymund,</hi> not by forreine compariſons, but by the eſſentiall properties of the infinite being, in the reall relations of every terme in unitie of that one being, hath with more cleereneſſe expreſſed to mans weake underſtanding, the unſpeakeable myſterie of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie in the unitie of one undivideable nature; as I have ſhewed in the Preface, in the being of goodneſſe, and Reaſon 3. of infinitie or greatneſſe, and Reaſon 8. of underſtanding. And although I would not erre from company; yet ſeeing I have ſuch company both of the ancient and later writers, which by the adverſary himſelfe are confeſſed to be of incomparable learning, and Divine honeſtie; I need not be aſhamed of my company. But notwithſtanding all this invective againſt reaſon in things of faith; ſee the young man by and by in the <hi>Sorbon.</hi> The power of God, ſaith he, in the creation of the world, wrought upon that which was not to cauſe it to be. Therefore God is Almightie: for this muſt be the concluſion, howſoever he would turne it to ſhut out the uſe of reaſon: but that will not follow upon the premiſes. So in the caſe of mans redemption, of the incarnation of God, of the reſurrection, hee is over the head and eares in <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and hiſtorie; but all to prove theſe things in reaſon impoſſible. And it is yeelded, that all theſe things are utterly beyond the courſe of nature, but yet upon better and higher principles than <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> knew, they will all appeare poſſible, and neceſſarie, and then his reaſons ſhall bee anſwered. To this order the declamer would bring their conſubſtantiation, and that which doth neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilie follow thereon, the bodilie preſence of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in everie place: And here he doth farre ſurpaſſe himſelfe, and by two bodies in one place, will prove it poſſible that one body may bee in all places; becauſe God hath abſolute power of all the nature of being. But if this reaſon be good and ſufficient, then is hee injurious and unconſtant to himſelfe, ſo to Hebarre the uſe of reaſon in the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions of faith: and if that bodily preſence of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in every place for which he labours ſo, had any ground in the Scripture, if it brought any hope or comfort to the conſcience; if the Primitive Church, or the Councels, or the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had ever taught it; I thinke that by this time reaſon would have found how to make it more probable than it is: but becauſe it is no Article of our Creed, it is not fit to trouble you any further hereabout.</p>

For ſome have utterly denyed the Trinitie of Perſons in the Unitie of the Godhead; others with this truth have blended their owne devices. The hereticks which held that as there was but one being in the Deitie, ſo there was but one Perſon called by divers names, of the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy Ghoſt; were of divers families, according to the names of the ſpeciall maintainers of this opinion; but beſt knowne by the name of <hi>Sabellius,</hi> one of the moſt ſubtile defenders thereof, about the yeere 260. which hereſie after a long ſleepe was againe awaked about the yeere 1110 by one <hi>Porretanus,</hi> who affirmed that the Perſons in the Godhead differ not, ſave onely in the apprehenſions of our minde, not by any reall or true di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction. The <hi>Iewes</hi> likewiſe among other reaſons doe therefore diſclaime the Chriſtian Religion; becauſe they ſuppoſe that by the Trinitie of Perſons, is taught a pluralitie of Gods, contrarie to that which is <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.4. <hi>The Lord our God is one Lord.</hi> The <hi>Turkes</hi> alſo denie the Trinitie of Perſons, and hold it therefore impoſſible for God to have a Sonne, becauſe he never had a wife. Now of thoſe that held a Trinitie, <hi>Simon</hi> that witch, of whom you reade, <hi>Actes</hi> 8. when the gall of his bitterneſſe had levened him thorowour, gave out
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:107656:50"/>of himſelfe, that he in the perſon of the Father gave the Law to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> ſuffered (in ſhew) under the Perſon of the Sonne, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward came downe on the Apoſtles in fierie tongues. <hi>Auguſt. de Haereſ. Cap.</hi> 1. <hi>Hierarcha</hi> alſo, from the words of the <hi>Nicen Creed, that Chriſt was light of light,</hi> affirmed, that the three Perſons were as three lights, of which one tooke light of another, and ſo he made the beings of the perſons ſeparate and apart, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Fathers in that Councell meant not any diviſion, or being apart, but that the Sonne is of the ſubſtance of the Father, without any leſſening or abatement of the Fathers being, as one light takes light of another without any loſſe of light in the former. The <hi>Metangiſmonites,</hi> ſo called from their opinion taken from veſſels, that they might avoid the opinion of the ſeparate being of the Perſons, held that they were as veſſels contained one within another, falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſuppoſing with the <hi>Anthropomorphites,</hi> or Man-ſhapers, that God was bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, and ſo conteined within a certaine ſpace, and againe miſunderſtanding that text of Scripture <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.11. where our Lord ſaith, <hi>I am in the Father;</hi> ſo that in the Divine nature they ſuppoſed ſome thing greater, which was the Father, and ſomething leſſe, which was the Sonne, and a third thing within them both, which was the Holy Ghoſt. But againſt that bodily being which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, you have reaſons ſufficient in the 9. <hi>Chapter.</hi> The text of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> makes the matter more plaine: for as it is impoſſible that two bodies ſhould bee each one within another (except by way of commixation) ſo it quite overthrowes that fooliſh opinion, becauſe it is thrice there added, that the Father is in the Sonne; ſo that of neceſſitie there can bee but one being of them both. For if the being of God be not moſt ſimple and pure, as was ſhewed before <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. And if every being anſwers to the Originall, then the eſſence of the Sonne muſt be moſt pure as the Father is; ſo that if each of the Perſons be in the other, there can be no difference but onely in the manner of being onely, <hi>See Auguſt. de Civit. Dei lib.</hi> 11. <hi>Cap.</hi> 10. Then concerning that third falſhood, which they ſuppoſed of a greater and leſſer being, it cannot poſſiblie ſtand with the nature of infinitie, whether it be underſtood of extenſion, or of vertue onely. The <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formians</hi> likewiſe to croſſe the errour of <hi>Sabellius,</hi> affirmed three Perſons, and that the whole and entyre being of the Godhead was in all the three taken toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; yet not in every perſon wholly, but ſo, as one part of it was in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, another part in the Sonne, and a third part in the Holy Ghoſt. By which falſhood it would follow, that the Godhead were in it ſelfe a divideable being and ſo a compound, contrary to that which is concluded <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. The <hi>Tritheites</hi> are yet more mad then the former, that it may appeare how boundleſſe errour is. They make the being of God not one and the ſam, as the <hi>Triformians</hi> did; but affirme that there is a threefold nature, and diſtinguiſh the Perſons in their eſſence, or abſolute being, in place alſo, and other differences of particular ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, as <hi>Peter, James, and Iohn,</hi> and ſo make three Gods, different and apart each from other. The <hi>Tetratheites</hi> would ſeeme more ſubtile then all that had beene before them: for they beſide the three Perſons of the Godhead, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a fourth being, which did communicate it ſelfe to all the three, by which communication of divine nature, everie one of thoſe three became God. By which ſottiſh opinion it muſt follow, that none of thoſe three Perſons could be either infinite, or eternall, if they receive their being from another; if they be God by grace onely and communication of another being than their owne; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can their being be ſimple and one, having one being of themſelves, and another imparted unto them. But if that being which they call that fourth common being, be that one moſt ſimple, pure, and eternall being, which wee confeſſe to be God; then it muſt follow neceſſarilie, that in that being there bee three Perſons, (as hath been declared in the <hi>Chapter</hi> before) in every one of which, the whole Godhead is all in all, and all in everie one, not by communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:107656:50"/>from another; nor by participation onely; but by the whole and proper poſſeſſion of every Perſon eſſentially; ſo that the Godhead is no other being than that which is in the three perſons; nor the three Perſons any other thing than that manner of being which is in the Godhead eternally: but they prove it thus; Where are one, and three trulie and really different, there muſt needs bee foure: But in the Deitie there is one being, and three Perſons really di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed, therefore foure ſeverall beings. I anſwer. Where is one, and three abſolute beings, there muſt needs be foure: but in the Godhead there is one abſolute being, and three manners of being, which are the Perſons; but the manner of being doth not make a number, different from the being: as <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac</hi> is one abſolute being in himſelfe; yet <hi>Jſaac</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Abraham</hi> is not a ſecond, nor <hi>Iſaac</hi> the father of Iacob a third. So the follie of this opinion, and the weakneſſe of their reaſons appearing; it remaines for the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of this moſt high myſterie, firſt that anſwer bee given to thoſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which <hi>Sabellius</hi> brought for his opinion; ſecondly, that the reaſons which are brought of the <hi>Tritheits</hi> be diſcuſſed.</p>
                           <p>But that no errour or miſtaking may grow concerning the faith in the truth of the thing, it will be neceſſarie to declare what manner of diſtinction or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference that is, which is to bee put between the Perſons of the Godhead: for if they be trulie and really diſtinguiſhed, it may ſeeme that their eſſence or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cannot bee one, and this was the errour of the <hi>Tritheites.</hi> But if they bee not really diſtinguiſhed, then there muſt bee but one Perſon in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, called by divers names, as <hi>Sabellius</hi> ſaid, or diſtinguiſhed by our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits alone, according to the opinion of <hi>Porretanus.</hi> The difference of things is either in their abſolute and eſſentiall being, and that either generall, ſpeciall, or individuall; as in things living, or lifeleſſe; men and beaſts, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn:</hi> or elſe it is according to their proprieties, difference of reſpects, or manner of being; as in <hi>Iſaac,</hi> his manly ſubſiſtence of his owne ſoule and body is his abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute individuall eſſence; yet in reſpect of the proprieties of his being, his ſonneſhip toward <hi>Abraham,</hi> his fatherhood toward <hi>Iacob,</hi> his lordſhip toward <hi>Rebecca,</hi> his maſterſhip towards <hi>Eleazar,</hi> &amp;c. are ſeverall things, and really di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed by that reality or being which is relative, or with peculiar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects to another. The third manner of difference is by circumſtantiall acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents onely; as one part of the white wall may ſeeme more ſhining and white than another, becauſe more light doth fall upon it. The fourth ſort of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences are onely ſuch, as wee in our underſtanding are compelled to make. The Perſons of the Godhead are not diſtinguiſhed one from another in their eſſence, or abſolute being, as the <hi>Tritheits</hi> affirm'd: for this is onely one in all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially: but yet in the manner of this being they are diſtinct truly and really; contrarie to that of <hi>Sabellius</hi> and <hi>Porretanus.</hi> For whether you reſpect that relation, which is among the Perſons one to another, the being of the Father, as a Father is with thoſe properties or reſpects which make a reall being of a Father, diſtinct from the Sonne, and ſo from that eternall action of his generation, whereby the Sonne is produced or brought forth; or whether you reſpect the Godhead abſolutely: yet ſeeing in that pure and ſimple being nothing can bee but eſſentiallie; it cannot bee more eſſentiall thereunto to bee one in the unitie of being, than it is to bee a Trinitie in the difference of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties; that is, that God bee what hee is in his eſſence or abſolute being, and as hee is in his manner of being. And as in the abſolute being of the Godhead, wee ſay according to the neceſſitie of the truth, that there is wiſdome, truth, goodneſſe, &amp;c. not as different eſſences, but as ſo many perfections, conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or dignities of that one infinite being; ſo likewiſe in the manner of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wee are compelled both by the ſacred authoritie of the holy text, and the enforcement of reaſon, (as hath beene ſhewed) to confeſſe a Trinitie of Perſons,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:107656:51"/>of which everie one is trulie and reallie diſtinguiſh't from another; ſo that there cannot poſſiblie bee a communitie or enterchange of their perſonall being. And this is that reall diſtinction that I meane, to wit, that cleere differences of the properties in the ſeverall Perſons, whereby they are not different eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences; nor different Gods; yet different beings, or different things, that is, divers termes of relation with the ſubſiſtences meant thereby, and in ſome ſort oppoſed. <hi>See log. Cap.</hi> 9. <hi>n.</hi> 14. For as in the uttermoſt ſimplicitie of their Divine being which is onely one; one not accidentally, or numerally, not of quantitie, but ſubſtantially one; it is not poſſible to ſuppoſe any difference of being, either reall, or intellectuall: ſo in the manner, and relative pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of that being, thoſe differences muſt needs be found, whereby thoſe termes of relation which wee call Perſons, are ſo truly and reallie diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, as that they cannot poſſiblie bee taken to bee one, either in their ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtences, or in our underſtanding. So then the Perſons of the deitie differ from the eſſence of the Deitie, not really, as one being differs from another being; which the <hi>Tetratheites</hi> affirmed: but as the order or manner of being differs from that manner of being wherein it hath the foundation. But the Perſons differ one from another, as the relative properties of a being may differ among themſelves, that is, not in their eſſence the foundation of the properties, for ſo they are but one God; but yet truly and really, according to thoſe differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces whereby the properties or relations are diſtinguiſhed: yet ſhall not theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences bring in any new or different eſſence into the ſimplicitie of the Divine being, becauſe they are onely relative, and ſuch as follow the manner of being. But becauſe it is eſſentiall unto the Divine being, to have in it ſelfe all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of being, therefore hath God not onelie a moſt pure, ſimple and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute being, whereby he is that which he is; but alſo the properties of an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and ſimple being, whereby he workes that which he workes infinitely and eternally. Therefore that feare of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> that the Chriſtian Religion by the Trinitie of Perſons brings in a pluralitie of Gods, is onely from their owne errour, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God, nor his eternall working.</p>
                           <p>But you aske what this manner of being or properties are, which adde nothing to the ſimplicitie of the Divine being, and yet are therein eſſentially? Have I tolde you all this while, and underſtand you not? The properties of the Divine being are of two ſorts, the firſt abſolute, the other relative. Whatſoever you adde to the ſimplicitie of being, muſt needs be a condition or propertie thereof; As if you ſay of the being of God, that it is moſt ſimple or pure, that is, One, Infinite, Eternall, Almightie, Glorious, Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>working, &amp;c. here puritie, unitie, infinitie, &amp;c. are the properties or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of that being, which wee call God, which although they ſeeme into us differing in their ſeverall reſpects; yet they adde no other being beſide that one moſt abſolute being of God; but onelie expreſſe to us the properties, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, or dignities thereof, without which that being could not bee perfect. The relative properties are ſuch as proceed from the eternitie of his activitie, life, or working: for the uttermoſt perfection of every thing is manifeſted by the actions thereof. And becauſe in him being and working are eſſentially one: therefore whatſoever doth neceſſarily follow, either his being, or his working, muſt alſo be in him eſſentially; and therfore are theſe relations which we call perſons, in the Godhead eſſentially, whoſe differences notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding depend immediately upon the working of the Divine Being. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> takes up this difference of properties gravely and wittily, thus. The being of God is ſaid to be ſimple, and ſo is, becauſe he is that which he hath, except that relation which every Perſon hath to another: For the Father hath the Son, yet is not the Son; and the Son hath his Father, yet is not that Father; but yet every
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:107656:51"/>Perſon in reſpect of himſelfe is that which he hath, as life, glorie, goodneſſe, &amp;c. This therefore is the ſimplicitie that he hath, and that which he hath is not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, that the qualitie is not one thing and the ſubſtance another; <hi>de civit. Dei lib.</hi> 11. <hi>Cap.</hi> 10. wee ſhall underſtand it better by inſtance in ſome of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine dignities. All the dignities of God are infinite in all the poſſibilities of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, both of being and working; for otherwiſe the dignitie were not infinitie, and he were not worthy to be God, if any thing might be more excellent than he. The glory therefore of God being infinite in working; He by that infinite wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his glorie, doth glorifie himſelfe infinitely. So God infinitely glorifying is God the Father, God infinitely glorified is God that Sonne, and that infinite action of glorification is God the Holy Ghoſt. As when the underſtanding of a man or Angell doth view or underſtand it ſelfe; then is it in it ſelfe, not onely by the eſſence of it ſelfe eſſentially; but alſo apprehended and underſtood by it ſelfe, according to the action of the underſtanding: ſo the mind underſtanding, is one terme really diſtinct from the minde underſtood, which is the image, word or expreſſion of the minde underſtanding; which minde doth alſo differ from the action of it ſelfe, whereby it doth underſtand it ſelfe. So God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther underſtanding himſelfe, is in himſelfe God underſtood, the image, word, or expreſſion of God underſtanding. This is that eternall Sonne infinitely and eternally brought forth: thus was the Word eternally with God, and that Word was God, and God was that Word. <hi>John</hi> 1. For as the actions of God doe not ceaſe; for then God ſhould ceaſe to bee God, if he were not everie way infinite: So doe they not proceed <hi>de potentia in actum,</hi> that is to take a beginning from whence to raiſe themſelves into perfection; for then they were not infinite <hi>a parte ante,</hi> and ſo not eternall. But becauſe God is wiſdome or underſtanding eſſentially: therefore is it eſſentiall unto him to underſtand himſelfe eternally. And this is that moſt glorious Sonne, God eternized, God underſtood, God glorified, willed, good, infinite, powerfull, &amp;c. by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite action of eternitie, wiſdome, glorie, will, goodneſſe, infinitie and power: which infinite action is God the Holy Ghoſt. Now if this infinite working and being of God bee one eſſentially, as hath beene proved, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. it muſt of neceſſitie follow, firſt that all the Perſons of the Godhead are coeternall, Secondlie, that as concerning their abſolute eſſence, there is no difference or inequalitie among them, inaſmuch as everie Perſon is by his owne being God eternally, as it is ſaid of the Sonne, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.6. <hi>That being in the forme or eſſence of the Godhead, he thought it no robberie to bee equall with God.</hi> For ſeeing the eſſence of the Godhead is one, and that which is one cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie beget it ſelfe; therefore neither the Sonne is from the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt from the Father and the Sonne, concerning their Godhead: but the Sonne is of the Father, as concerning his perſonall ſubſiſtence, and ſo the Holy Ghoſt is from the Father and the Sonne, inaſmuch as the Sonne is not underſtood eternized or glorified; but by the action of that being which is actuallie underſtanding, eternall, and glorious: neither can there be any acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of underſtanding, eternizing, and glorifying, where there is not both the perſon underſtanding, eternizing, and glorifying; and there perſon underſtood, eternized, and glorified. Then this generation of the Sonne being onely by the eternall action of the Deitie, it may appeare how beaſtlie and ſenſuall that Religion of <hi>Mahomet</hi> is, which cannot thinke of any other generation than that which is betweene a male and his female. Oh ſcorne and contempt even of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt thoughts! yet thus theſe ſwine plot to themſelves their happineſſe in the life to come, in feaſting and ſporting, and fleſhly pleaſure with beautifull wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. <hi>See Went (a) Bud. pag.</hi> 157. Woe unto that covering of God, but his end is at hand, and his deſtruction lingereth not: But the anſwer to this argument, <hi>See Chap.</hi> 34. § 5. <hi>n.</hi> 8.</p>

                           <p>Concerning the perſon of the Sonne more particularlie you may reade here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after in the 24. <hi>Chapter,</hi> and of the Holy Ghoſt in the 33. It remaines here onely to anſwer to thoſe objections which may bee brought againſt this faith of the Holy Trinitie.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. And firſt it may be ſaid by the adverſaries of this truth, that the defenders thereof doe not agree among themſelves: for <hi>Thom. Aquinas in Senten. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>diſt.</hi> 2. <hi>q.</hi> 2. brings this as an objection. That the perſons are diſtinguiſhed by their properties, or manner of being onely, therefore not really. In anſwer to which hee ſaith, That everie terme of relation inaſmuch as it is ſuch, muſt needs bee diſtinguiſhed from that whereto it is referred, ſeeing they are oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by a relative oppoſition; and therefore are really differing: For things are either abſolute, as the eſſences or ſimple beings of things in themſelves; or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative, as the Father and the Sonne, which differ alſo really; ſo that although they are not different eſſences, yet are they moe or different things. <hi>Reſ.</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, according to the uttermoſt differences which may bee in that manner of being, which is founded immediately in the Divine eſſence, or which is all one, in the working thereof. Againe <hi>Keckerman, Syſtem. Theolog. Cap.</hi> 4. to that objection of the <hi>Antitrinitarians;</hi> that if there be unitie of eſſence, and difference of perſons, a ſubject and a relation, a ſubſtance and an accident; then in the Godhead there ſhould bee compoſition; which becauſe it is not poſſible to be; therefore there are no ſuch different relations; anſwers, and brings in the conſent of <hi>Zanchius,</hi> that relation is not any thing of reall being; that it is not any accident becauſe it is not being, but imports onely the manner, order or reſpect of being. If this be true, where is then that reall difference, as <hi>Thomas</hi> ſpeakes? But theſe things are nothing different, if well examined. The purpoſe of one, and of the other, and of all right meaning Doctours is utterly to deny againſt the <hi>Tritheits</hi> all pluralitie or diverſitie of eſſences or abſolute beings. And as <hi>Keckerman</hi> for avoyding of any accidentall being in the diſtinction of the perſons, ſaith; that relation is not a thing of being, but onely imports the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, manner, or reſpect of beings one toward another; ſo <hi>Thomas</hi> to meerfully with that hereſie of <hi>Sabellius</hi> and <hi>Perretanus,</hi> that the diſtinction of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons was onely in names, or our underſtanding, holds the Perſons to differ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and to be different things eternally without and utterly beyond our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, yet conceive him ſo, as that theſe reall differences are onely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall, and in the order or manner of their being, as I have ſhewed before. But it may bee that you are not yet ſatisfied for the ſeeming difference between theſe Doctors: for if this relation which they make betweene the Perſons of the Deitie, be neither ſubſtance nor accident, nor at all any thing of very being (as <hi>Keckerman</hi> ſuppoſes) but onely a manner of being, which (for ought that I can conceive) being nothing of being, muſt bee but a meere conceit of ours, the opinion of <hi>Sabellius</hi> muſt ſtand for truth; and ſo on the other ſide, if theſe relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be the very beings or things ſubſiſting; nay, if the Divine being be the very relation of the Fatherhood and Sonneſhip, as <hi>Thomas</hi> affirmes both, <hi>contra Gent. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 14. then if the Fatherhood differ from the Sonneſhip, and that reallie (as being in Divine eſſence, the difference muſt be moſt reall) and ſo the Sonneſhip from the Fatherhood; and both of them from the proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt; it ſeemes that the Divine being muſt differ really from it ſelfe, and ſo there can bee but one being of all the Perſons, as <hi>Arrius</hi> affirmed. By relation you may underſtand either that logicall notion which is between the termes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative &amp; correlative, and ſo the ſayings of <hi>Kecker.</hi> are juſtifiable, or elſe you may meane thereby the things ſpoken of, with that mutuall reſpect which they have each to other, and ſo you muſt underſtand the doctrine of S. <hi>Thomas.</hi> For your further ſatisfaction remembes what I told you <hi>Introduct. in log. Sect.</hi> 4. <hi>n.</hi> 11. That thoſe relations which I can neceſſary, commonly called <hi>ſecundum eſſe,</hi> are
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:107656:52"/>ſuch words as ſignifie, firſt, that mutuall reſpect which they have to their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relatives; and then thoſe beings whereon they depend fundamentally. As the name Father, firſt hath reference to a childe; next, it imports the ſubſiſtence, or perſon, as of <hi>Abraham</hi> or <hi>Ieſſe;</hi> ſo double, firſt underſtands ſingle; leſſe greater; next quantities. Therefore though I thinke it not fitly ſaid, that the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is the divine eſſence, or that the eſſence is in the Fatherhood, as <hi>Thomas</hi> ſpeakes; for eſſence imports the ſimple and abſolute being, and father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood that reference which is to another: yet theſe relations ſhall not bee ſo meerely the manner of being, but that they may make a reall difference from their correlatives, not onely in regard of that <hi>ſubſtratum,</hi> or thing meant in their ſecond ſignification, which is really differing from the thing oppoſed; as a Father, from a Sonne, <hi>Ieſſe</hi> from <hi>David;</hi> but alſo in reſpect of that being whereon theſe relations are founded immediately: as in <hi>Abrabam</hi> that lively or naturall ſtrength whereby he is enabled to beget his like; in <hi>Iſaack</hi> that lively humanity which was begotten. As unity the tranſcendent is convertible with being, both which in quantities are the ground of evenneſſe, or equality; in qualities, of likeneſſe. And therefore <hi>Keckerman</hi> to ſhun a pluralitie of being, doth unneceſſarily avoyd that reall difference, which it is neceſſary to put in the Perſons of the Trinity, wherein there are more or divers ſubſiſtent beings, if you reſpect the Perſons, or relations: but one thing alone, if you regard the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. For the realty in the difference of the relations, can no way enforce a plurality in their abſolute beings, but onely an incommunicable propriety in the things that are different. For although in natures created, ſome attributes be eſſentiall, which are in the thing moſt perfectly: Some accidentall, as learning, Iuſtice, and ſuch other which are not perfect in us: ſome againe are but onely relative, which of all other moſt imperfectly belong unto us, as not neceſſary to our being, but ſometime depend on things without; as a maſterſhip on his ſervants, a fatherhood on his children; and even thoſe relations which are nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, doe preſuppoſe not only the being of the ſubject, but alſo ſuch accidents in the ſubject, from whence the Relation doth ariſe; as the right hand, and left hand from the poſition of the members, yet in the ſuperexcellencie of the divine being, whereto no perfection can bee wanting, which is poſſible to be either in the being, or manner of being; in the working, or manner of working; it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that all things be ſupereminently, according to the moſt perfect manner of being, that is eſſentially. And therefore theſe relations, which are in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, are not ſo called properly, as being utterly in the ſimplicity of that being which is utterly in dependent: yet becauſe hee hath reveiled himſelfe unto us by the name of the Father, the Word, and the Spirit, one being: in the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of which wee come neareſt to that relation which is properly ſo called in the creature: we are compeld for helpe of our owne underſtanding, which wee finde ſo dazeled at that infinite light, to hide our Eyes, and by little and little, as by degrees, to take a glympſe thereof, and ſo to ſpeake according to that light which we diſcerne. And as in the degrees of light, firſt we ſee the dawning, then the ſhine or cleare light; after the Beames, and laſtly the body of the Sunne: So contrariwiſe in the knowledge of God from that fountaine of Light. His being which is reflected in all the creatures, wee view the beames, or immediate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections thereof. His goodneſſe, eternity, wiſdome, and glory: and theſe ſhew themſelves firſt in their inward working; and afterward at an infinite diſtance in the creature, outwardly. In their in ward working, becauſe they are infinite, we muſt acknowledge an infinite agent, an infinite object, an infinite action; or the termes or limits of all action, from whence, wherto, &amp; the middle terme between theſe two, which we call Perſons. And ſo though our guide his word, bee that Light which ſhines in the darkeneſſe; yet we muſt confeſſe that he dwels in the Light, whereto none can approach, which to us is all one with that darkeneſſe
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:107656:53"/>which he hath made his pavillion. And as in the Being which wee conceive ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, wee put different perfections of wiſdome, of power, of goodneſſe, &amp;c. which nevertheleſſe wee muſt confeſſe to bee one perfection; though they bee truly diſtinguiſhed betweene themſelves: So in the different relations, which wee call Perſons, though wee know and confeſſe them to bee really different; yet muſt wee acknowledge the ſubſiſtences one in their abſolute being. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the underſtanding in the confideration of created beings, wonders how all theſe things can bee in that uttermoſt ſimplicity and unity of Being, and that after one moſt imple manner of Being, eſſentially; yet when it remembers that that being is therefore moſt perfect, becauſe it is moſt ſimple, and that no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of perfection can bee wanting to that which is moſt perfect, it diſpoiles it ſelfe of all thoſe rules which it doth verifie in created things; and becauſe it is not able by one ſimple apprehenſion in it ſelfe, either to conceive, much leſſe to expreſſe that perfection which is in the ſimplicity of the divine being; it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with thoſe expreſſions which it is able to make thereof; ſo that the truth and majeſtie of the thing bee not hurt thereby. Therefore whether s. <hi>Thomas</hi> deliver it thus, or <hi>Zanchius</hi> thus; So long as we know they meane no other thing than that which the holy Scripture hath taught us, wee ought not to receive with the left haud, that which they deliver with the right.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Now for the opinion of <hi>Sabellius,</hi> it is ſaid, That if every one of the Perſons, be the divine Being, then ſhall they all bee but one Perſon. But every Perſon in the Deity is the whole divine Being: or if the Sonne, and the Holy Ghoſt be not the whole divine being, then can they not be God, as <hi>Arrius</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Although nothing of the Divine being bee without or beſide the Perſons, but that every Perſon is perfectly God, yet the manner of being cannot be the abſolute Being of a thing, ſo the aſſumption is falſe. And although every Perſon, in reſpect of his abſolute Being, be very God, yet is it not ſaid, that any Perſon according to his perſonall properties is the whole divine being, no more than the Son-ſhip of <hi>Iſaack</hi> is his humanity, ſo the conſequence for <hi>Arrius</hi> will not hold.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. What two things ſoever agree in a third, muſt needes agree betweene themſelves. The Father and the Sonne agree in the unity of eſſence: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are one betweene themſelves. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The argument is fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from ſpecialty, as I ſhewed <hi>log. chap.</hi> 22. <hi>n.</hi> 2. For the rule holds onely in equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of quantities, except you reſtreine it to that wherein the agreement is: ſo the Father and the Son agree in the unity of their eſſence, but differ in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall properties.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. The eſſence of God is moſt ſimply and ſubſtantially one, and therefore firſt not differing from it ſelfe. Secondly, incommunicable to three. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Firſt the difference is not betweene it ſelfe, and it ſelfe: but in the properties which are eſſentially in it ſelfe, as the individuall being of <hi>Iſaack</hi> differs not from it ſelfe, but his Fatherhood toward <hi>Iacob,</hi> and his Sonſhip toward <hi>Abraham,</hi> are as really different, that is as diverſe properties, as Fatherhood, and Sonſhip can bee. Secondly, The three Perſons are not ſeverall eſſences, but all one eſſence incommunicable to any other, but they are diverſe relations in that one abſolute being.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. A Perſon in the deity is either finite, or infinite: if finite, he cannot bee God: if infinite, then if there be three Perſons, there muſt alſo bee three infinites; or if theſe three infinites bee but one infinite, then is there but one infinite Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, called by diverſe names. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Infinity in the Deity is the condition of the abſolute being, not of the propriety, or manner of being; as to be reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is in <hi>Iſaack,</hi> the property or condition, not of his Fatherhood, nor of his Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but of his humanity only.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. If there bee moe Perſons than one, in the one onely abſolute being of the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:107656:53"/>Godhead; then it is neceſſary that there bee ſomething in them whereby they muſt be diſtinguiſhed, and ſo every Perſon muſt bee compounded; or if to avoid compoſition, you ſay that this diſtinction is onely in relation, which brings not any new being, but onely reſpect to another; yet relation cannot bee without ſome abſolute being whereon it is grounded. As in a ſervant there is a being beſides that reference which he hath to his maſter. Nay if this abſolute being bee the individuall and moſt ſimple eſſence of the Deitie; yet that cannot be the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of diverſe relations, becauſe of the uttermoſt unity and ſimplicity thereof. And if theſe relations have any other foundation, it is not poſſible to avoid compoſition: therefore there is not any plurality or difference of Perſons. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</hi> You were told before; That whatſoever is in God, is in Him eſſentially, that it is not more eſſentiall to Him to bee one God, then to be three in the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of Perſons, becauſe perfection both of being, and manner of being are in him according to his moſt ſimple being. For the diverſe perfections of the creature came thereto by the manifold formes therein over and above the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall formes, and muſt of force bee Accidents. But the ſuperexcellency of the ſimplicity of the divine being, being the cauſe of all perfection therein, ſuffers neither compoſition nor accident, as hath beene ſhewed, <hi>chap.</hi> 9. therefore as in the divine being, neither goodneſſe, wiſdome, nor power, adde any thing of new being, ſo in the working, the diverſe termes of agent, action, object, or any other words whereby we expreſſed the difference of relations, or Perſons, doe not adde any thing to the ſimplicity either of being, or working, though they bee therein eſſentially. No nor yet are they properly ſaid to be founded therein as any other things different therefrom; though we in our weake underſtanding can neither conceive, nor expreſſe them but as different termes of relation proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo called. Neither yet ſhall it follow from hence that the perſons are not really and truly diſtinguiſhed, for the very being of the Father as he is a Father, is in this, Hee doth eternally bring forth his Sonne. And likewiſe the Being of the Sonne, that he is brought forth of the Father, by the infinite and eternall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Father, in himſelfe; but rather, becauſe this production is infinite and eternall (as was ſhewed) therefore the Perſons alſo as concerning their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall proprieties, muſt be different eternally, though in their abſolute and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuall being they bee one eſſentially; ſo that as in relations properly ſo called, there is the ſubſtance, the attribute, and the relation which followes thereon: ſo likewiſe here is firſt the abſolute Being of the Deity; then the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thereof; and laſtly the termes of that action, or the relations enſuing, which we call Perſons; yet with this difference, that in the relations of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the attribute and the relation ſucceeding, are both accounted accidents: But here in the deity all things are eſſentially, ſo that although the ſimple or abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Being of the deitie bee not the foundation of divers relations, yet the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof muſt needs admit theſe different termes which we call relations or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and that without compoſition, either to make diſtinction of the perſons, or to avoid confuſion in them.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. That relation whereby the Perſons are diſtinguiſhed, either is ſomething of very being, or elſe it is in the underſtanding onely. If it be in our underſtanding onely, then can it not make any perſonall diſtinction: if it bee any thing of very being, yet can it not be that abſolute Being common to all; and if it be anything different therefrom, then muſt ſomething be in the Perſons beſide their abſolute eſſence; which becauſe it is impoſſible, it followes, that there is no diſtinction of Perſons. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> This argument is in effect all one with the former; And you ought to have remembred, that it hath of ten beene ſaid, that the diſtinction of the perſons is reall; and therefore not in our underſtanding onely. The Perſons taken together in their abſolute eſſence admit to diſtinction, but are all eſſenrially one God. And ſo every perſon by himſelfe in his eſſence is likewiſe
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:107656:54"/>God. But the perſons underſtood apart according to the propriety of their perſonall beings, are really diſtinguiſhed, and that reall diſtinction is their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonality, and that perſonality is their reall diſtinction; and that relation whereby they are diſtinguiſhed, is nothing different from any of theſe; nor yet the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of their perſonall being is any other thing than that relation. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though the perſons are not diſtinguiſhed by or in that abſolute being wherein they are all one; yet is it moſt falſely brought in thereby, that any thing ſhall bee in them beſide their eſſence, whereby they are diſtinguiſhed. For the diſtinction, or difference of the perſons ariſes from the action onely, or working of the Abſolute Being, which yet is eſſentially in the abſolute Being, and differs not therefrom, no more than heat in the fyer doth differ eſſentially from the fyer; or reaſon, feeling, and growth in a man, doth differ eſſentially from the ſoule of man.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. Every relative depends neceſſarily upon the correlative. But nothing which is depending upon another, can be truely God. Therefore either the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons differ not by relations only; or none of the perſons can be God; or elſe there is no relation, and ſo no diſtinction of the perſons at all. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It is a fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and froward kinde of arguing, to preſſe the propriety of ſpeech or uſe of words to darken the truth of things, ſee <hi>log. cap.</hi> 21. <hi>n.</hi> 5. It hath beene ſaid, 1. that the being of God is ſupereminently above all being, above all created underſtanding to conceive. 2. That relation in created things doth not onely preſuppoſe a ſubject, but alſo ſome quantity, quality, action, or other affection in the ſubject whereon that relation doth depend. 3. That thoſe relations in the perſons of the deity are nothing elſe but the very perſonall proprieties, and that the word Relation (as many other beſide) is taken into uſe in this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument onely, to helpe the expreſſing of our underſtanding, though indeed properly it bee not in the divine being, yet can we not conceive but that there is an order in the proceſſion of the perſons (as I have ſaid elſewhere) yet not ſuch as ſhall bring in any dependence, no not in the perſonall proprieties, becauſe the action or eternall working whence the perſonall differences doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, is eſſentially in the Godhead; or if dependence muſt needes bee yeelded unto, yet ſeeing it can bee nothing but onely the order of proceſſion in the perſons of the Godhead, it brings in no ſuch inconvenience, as that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it ſhould follow, that either the Sonne, or the Holy Ghoſt were not God. So the foundation of the doubt being but a hil of ſand, the whole building proves but a trifle.</p>
                           <p>And theſe are the principall reaſons brought for the Sabellian hereſie. The authorities of the Holy Scripture which they falſely alleage hereto, are ſuch as prove the abſolute unitie of the divine Being, as you have heard before in the end of the eighth Chapter: which Texts as they doe moſt ſtrongly confirme the eternall truth of the abſolute being of one God: ſo doe they nothing gain ſay the Trinitie of the Perſons, which other Texts of the Scripture reach, as you have partly heard, and ſhall heare further hereafter, when wee come to ſpeake in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular of the Perſons of the Sonne, and of the Holy Ghoſt. So it remaines now, only to anſwer that which is brought for the opinion of the Tritheites, which poore fancie though it may vaniſh at the fight of the Reaſons which have beene brought for the ſimple and one Being of God in the eight Chapter: yet becauſe it would juſtifie it ſelfe by this doctrine of the Trinitie; you ſhall ſee what the ſtrength of their Reaſon is.</p>
                           <p n="9">9 That which is begotten and that which is not begotten, muſt needs be very different. The perſons of the Trinity are begotten, as the Sonne; and not begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, as the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt. Therefore if every perſon be God, they are different Gods. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The things, which in no reſpect are different, muſt be the ſame; and there can bee no difference put betweene things, which brings
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:107656:54"/>not in a deniall on the one ſide, and an affirmation on the other. And this oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is betweene all things howſoever differing. So betweene the Perſons of the Deity there muſt be a relative oppoſition. As the Father, <hi>ergo,</hi> not the Sonne: the Sonne, <hi>ergo,</hi> not the Father, &amp;c. becauſe there is a relative diſtinction; but this doth nothing at all enforce a plurality of Gods, or a difference of abſolute Beings, but of the Perſons onely.</p>
                           <p>And if you deſire to ſee other arguments like theſe, reade <hi>Thomas Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas. cont. Gent. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 10. and their Anſwers. <hi>cap.</hi> 14. ſee alſo the note <hi>(a)</hi> on the 24. <hi>chap.</hi> following, <hi>ſect.</hi> 9. and note <hi>(a)</hi> on the 33. <hi>chap.</hi> But the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to all objections will bee eaſie, if you remember what hath beene ſaid, and ſuffer not yourſelfe to be carryed away with ſhew of reaſons taken from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall things; which though they bee moſt true in the creature, which had a beginning; yet can they no way bound or binde the infinite and eternall truth of Him that is Lord and Creator of nature, as I have remembred you elſewhere. Remember alſo to conſider in Chriſt, his eſſence, which in all the Perſons is coeternall and one: and His Perſon begotten eternally of the Father. And in this Perſon diſtinguiſh His natures divine, and humane, from his offices: wherein remember. 1. that His ſending and obedience abate nothing from His equalitie with the Father, concerning the unity of their eſſence. 2. that theſe names which import His office, are ſpoken of Him in reſpect of both His natures.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou miſſe here a great deale of learning and wit, which other men have ſhewed in the myſtery of unity, and the number of the Three. But becauſe the reaſons that might bee made from thence, would bee but onely inductive; and I deſire to ſtand with you on the lower and plaine ground; let us leave thoſe high Speculations to them that pleaſe to read them among the Cabaliſts, in <hi>Brixianus</hi> his <hi>comment. Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol.</hi> and elſewhere, and ſee what other reaſons can be brought for the queſtion in hand.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Nothing can poſſibly be in the Deity but according to the uttermoſt perfection of Being: that is eſſentially, and neceſſarily. Therefore if it bee not neceſſary to put moe Perſons than Three in the Godhead, then is it not poſſible. But it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to put moe perſons in the divine Being: either Father Son or holy Ghoſt. For ſo the Fatherhood, Sonſhip, and proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt ſhould not bee perfect in theſe. And if in theſe
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:107656:55"/>Perſons there ſhould not bee perfect Production; then it might follow, that there were a diſability in the producer; and ſo the firſt principle of all ſhould bee imperfect, unable and weake. So nothing beſides it, nothing after it could bee perfect. But all theſe things are impoſſible. Or if the other Perſon, or Perſons to be put in the Godhead, ſhould be neither Fathers, becauſe they did not produce; nor Sons, becauſe they were not produced; nor yet Holy Ghoſts, as not proceeding: then ſhould they bee moſt idle, and defective in the firſt principle of all Being; and therefore not neceſſary, and therefore not poſſible.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The ſame number muſt be to the Perſons of the deitie, which is to the termes or perfections of the divine dignities, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the perfections of the dignities, and the Perſons of the Deity could not bee conſubſtantiall and the ſame, as hath beene ſhewed. But the perfections of the dignities are three eſſentially. For in that which is eſſentially wiſdome or underſtanding (as we have proved that God is, <hi>c.</hi> 8.) the action of underſtanding is an eſſentiall meane betweene that which doth underſtand, and that which is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and theſe three termes are one underſtanding, and one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding hath theſe three eſſentially. Therefore in God there is unity of eſſence, and that ſubſtantiall: and likewiſe a Trinity of Perſons and yet ſubſtantiall, that the termes may differ infinitely from accident, confuſion, &amp; contrariety. But if the Trinity be in the Deity ſubſtantially; it is impoſſible there ſhould bee moe, or fewer Perſons therein than three.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. If in the Godhead there bee but one infinite Agent, whoſe Action is likewiſe one infinite Action like himſelfe, then it muſt needs bee, that the object of this action be alſo infinite and one. But it hath beene proved, that, God this agent of whom I ſpeake, is onely one <hi>chap.</hi> 8. and that his action is infinite and one, <hi>chap.</hi> 10. For if it were not infinite, it could not bee one, nor in Him One, if not infinite: Neither yet can the action be infinite if the object be finite; nor one, if the objects be many. And beyond theſe it is impoſſible to aſſigne any limit or terme neceſſary to action; nor yet can action bee without any of theſe, as you may underſtand by this inſuing induction. Therefore in the Deity, the Perſons are three onely and no moe.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The power and propriety of all inferiour cauſes depends onely on the higheſt and firſt cauſe of all. And all effects are the true images of their cauſes. And no action can bee perfect but in the number of three. For the perfection of every action is in the Agent, the obiect, and the action thereabout, and theſe are one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly three. So the termes of motion, from whence, whereto, and the middle terme between them are onely three. <hi rend="sup">a</hi> Therefore the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perſons are three and no moe.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. The whole being of a beginning muſt needs be moſt perfectly in that which is the firſt and chiefe beginning of all beginnings:
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:107656:55"/>ſo as that it cannot receive a Beginning from another, nor yet bee a beginning to it ſelfe; ſo can it not bee worthy the name of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, if it be not a beginning to another Being coeſſentiall, and like it ſelfe. But in the perfect being of a beginning taken actively and paſſively, there muſt bee three termes and no moe; that is a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginner, a Being begun, and an action of Beginning. Therefore there be three Perſons in the Deity and no moe. And this is that which is ſaid, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.6. <hi>There is one God and Father of all, and Ioh.</hi> 1.18. <hi>The onely Begotten Sonne which is in the boſome of the Father hath declared Him unto us.</hi> And againe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.4. <hi>There is one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, &amp;c.</hi> And yet more cleerely, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.7. <hi>There are three which beare Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in Heaven, the Father, the word, and the Holy Ghoſt, and theſe three are one.</hi>

Oſiander</hi> by <hi>Murschell</hi> the declamer of whom I ſpake before <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>note. c.</hi> That if the Father by the view and underſtanding of Himſelfe doth bring forth a Perſon like Himſelfe; then the Sonne alſo, and Holy Ghoſt by view of Themſelves, ſhall bring forth ſeverall Perſons like themſelves: and ſo there ſhall be a multiplication of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons infinity: or if theſe two Perſons doe not bring forth Perſons like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; it muſt needes follow, either that they are deſtitute of the power of underſtanding; or that the underſtanding of the Father is more noble and powerfull than theirs. But this is impoſſible. For ſo the conſubſtantiality of the Perſons ſhould bee taken away. And this objection in their opinion is like thoſe great Stones wherewith <hi>Ioſhua</hi> ſhut up the five Kings in the Cave. But I ſay, rather like that feale of the Iewes on the tombe of Chriſt, whereby they thought to have ſhut up the Lord of life among the dead. But thus is Hee wounded in the houſe of his friends. For you may not thinke that hereby they prepare to Iuſtifie the <hi>Tritheites</hi> or any other Hereticks, but onely to ſet reaſon againſt reaſon, and to ſhew how inconvenient the uſe of reaſon is in matiers of Faith. But before I goe any further, I would aske a queſtion or two of theſe oppoſers. Is not the Sonne begotten of the Father? you dare not denie it; It is the word of the Scripture, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.1. Is Hee not conſubſtantiall with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? you dare not deny it. For the Father, and Hee are one, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.30. If then Goodneſſe, Infinity, eternity, almightineſſe, wiſdome, &amp;c. be the very being of God, as hath beene proved; is it not neceſſary that theſe excellencies bee active in that divine generation? for how otherwiſe can He be the Image of his Father? <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. And if ſo, wherein have <hi>Raimund, Melancthon, Scaliger, Keckerman,</hi> or other learned men offended, that they ſhould bee ſo ſet at nought by a Phraſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatherer? But I ſmell the Fox; they can ſophiſticate authority of Scripture, of Fathers, of Councels, for their Conſubſtantiation, the maine point of their private opinion: But by no meanes can they tell how to make it ſtand with reaſon, &amp; therfore that their conſubſtantiation might be a matter of Faith, would they ſo fain make a divorce between faith &amp; reaſon. If this were not the very cauſe, ſo great
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:107656:56"/>a Clearke as <hi>Oſiander,</hi> ſeeing his reaſon was contrary to his faith, if he could not have anſwered it, ſhould have ſtudied thereunto, leſt it might turne the unſtable from the Faith. But what if wilfully he would not know? had he read nothing of <hi>Tho. Aquinas?</hi> This <hi>Thomas</hi> propoſes this ſame doubt, and anſwers it in his firſt booke on the Maſter of Sent. <hi>Diſt.</hi> 7. <hi>q.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4. where he makes the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection thus. All the power which is in the Father, is alſo in the Sonne: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo the power of begetting. To which hee anſwers, that the word Power, doth fignifie either the ſimple eſſence of power, and ſo it is in all the Perſons one and the ſame: or the order thereof to ſome determinate Act; and ſo the ſame power is in the Father, and the Son; but in the Father to beget, and not to be begotten: in the Sonne to be begotten, and not to beget, and this is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all diſtinction of their Perſons. So that the objection is onely from that fallacy of the Accident, ſee <hi>log. chap.</hi> 21. <hi>n.</hi> 3. To this hee brings the reaſons of <hi>Anſelme.</hi> The leaſt inconveience is not poſſible to be in the Godhead, but if the Son could beget another Son, and He againe another Sonne, &amp;c. the proceſſe might be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite. But this is impoſſible. Therefore the Sonne cannot beget, no more than He can ceaſe to bee a Sonne, and to be begotten. Againe, He that cannot bee the Father, cannot beget. But the Sonne cannot bee the Father; for ſo all diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and propriety of the Perſons ſhould bee taken away. Therefore the Sonne begets not: nor yet the Father begets any other Sonne. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1.14, 18. For as nothing of the Fatherhood can bee out of the Father, ſo nothing of the Sonſhip can be out of the Son, for ſo the production of the Sonne ſhould not be perfect: neither is the dignity of their eſſence anything abated hereby: for that in every Perſon is onely one: but in the Father, it is called Fatherhood; in the Sonne it is called Sonſhip; and in the Holy Ghoſt it is called Proceſſion. And againe, in his <hi>Sum. Theol. part.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 42. he proves there can be but one Father, one Sonne, and one Holy Ghoſt, for ſuch reaſons as you may reade there and iudge of their force. Moreover in the 4. booke <hi>cont. Gent. cap.</hi> 13. he propoſes this very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection almoſt in ſo many words, and anſwers it thus. The Sonne of God is alſo God, yet not another God; diſtering onely in this, that Hee proceeds from the Father. And if he be not any other God; then alſo muſt there be one Power, one underſtanding of them both. So that the Sonne differs from the Father, onely in this, that hee proceeds from Him; and this is the propriety of the Father, that the Word proceeds from Him; and of the Sonne, that hee proceeds from the Father. Neither is this any weakeneſſe in the Sonne, that he begets not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Sonne, becauſe both the Father, and the Sonne, are as the ſame Deny; ſo the ſame power: one of begetting, the other of being begotten, which diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is onely in the relations. And againe in the 26. chap. of the ſame booke he anſwers. That hee that makes this objection ought to have conſidered; that the Sonne of God is God; not as begetting; but onely as being begotten. For the eſſence being one, the difference betweene them muſt bee onely by that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation which is in their originall, or proceſſion. Relation (I ſay) not that which is founded in quality; for ſo there would bee unlikeneſſe: nor that which is in quantity; for ſo there would bee inequality in their being; but that which is in action onely, action (I meane) not tranſient, wherein the Agent hath a prerogative of power, on an outward ſubject, to cauſe paſſion therein; but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent onely; wherein that which is produced, is coeſſentiall and coequall with the producer: So that the difference is onely in the order of proceſſion onely. But I ſuppoſe ſuch a learned Maſter as <hi>Oſiander,</hi> whoſe petits dare ſo boldly cenſure, and ſet at nought whom they pleaſe, could not bee ignorant what ſo great a Doctor as <hi>Thomas,</hi> had ſo often anſwered. It may be he held the anſwers inſufficient; yet he ſhould have ſhewed the weakeneſſe thereof. He held it not worth his paynes: a careleſſe anſwer. But let us once more be bold to looke on this mighty <hi>Goliah</hi> a little nearer, and try what cunning he hath, at his weapon.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:107656:56"/>If the Father by the underſtanding of himſelfe doth bring forth a Perſon like himſelfe, then the Sonne alſo, and Holy Ghoſt by underſtanding themſelves ſhall bring forth perſons like themſelves: for otherwiſe they cannot be <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap> or conſubſtantiall. I denie the conſequence, and why? becauſe the reaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of bindes mee to denie it: for if the Perſons bee conſubſtantiall, that is, of one and the ſame moſt ſimple being; it is neceſſary, firſt that the whole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be in everie Perſon: for if the being bee divideable (as <hi>Hierarcha</hi> and the <hi>Triformians</hi> thought) then can it not be moſt ſimplie one. Secondly, that that one moſt ſimple being, be likewiſe no other thing than the three Perſons: for if that infinite being, might by the manifold actions of the underſtanding bee imparted by every one of thoſe Perſons, to multiplie moe Perſons, then ſhould they not bee <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap> but <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap>, as <hi>Arius</hi> granted, that is, not of one and the ſame, but onelie of like being, as <hi>Peter, Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> of which everie one hath the common abilitie of kinde to propagate his like. But thus the being in the three Perſons could not be individuall and one, but the Father communicates his whole being to the Sonne, ſo that there remaines no difference of being, but of principall, originall, or begetting onely. Moreover the conſequence cannot follow but upon this moſt falſe ſuppoſition, that there be divers intellections or ſeverall workings of the Divine underſtanding in every Perſon: whereas the underſtanding of God, being his moſt ſimple being, and that moſt individually one, the action likewiſe of his underſtanding muſt bee but one moſt ſimple act of underſtanding, infinitely and eternally: for as hee cannot ceaſe to bee; ſo can hee not ceaſe to underſtand at one action infinitely and eternally whatſoever is underſtandable in himſelfe or his creature: ſo that the Perſons cannot have ſeverall acts of underſtanding, as accidents or proprieties, nor yet can they bee any other thing than the ſeverall termes properties or ſubſiſtences in that one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite underſtanding, as our Lord teacheth us <hi>John</hi> 5.19. The Sonne can doe nothing of himſelfe, ſave what he ſeeth the Father doe: for whatſoever things he doth, the ſame things alſo doth the Sonne like wiſe.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, this conſequence doth not onely utterlie take away the diſtinction of perſons (as was ſhewed) but would alſo thruſt into the Divine underſtanding that which is utterly falſe and utterly impoſſible, &amp; that contrary to the evidence of the Holie text: for our Lord ſaith, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.15. <hi>As the Father knoweth me, ſo know J the Father.</hi> But it is certaine that the Father knoweth not any thing but as it is: therefore not the Sonne, but as the Sonne; neither doth the Sonne know the Father, but as the Father; nor yet himſelfe, but as the Sonne: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it being impoſſible for the Perſons to underſtand themſelves otherwiſe than they are; it is not poſſible for the Sonne or the Holy Ghoſt by underſtanding themſelves, to become the Father, and ſo to bring out other Perſons, as this lewd conſequence would enforce.</p>
                           <p>But the ground of this miſtaking (which I tell you of for avoiding of the like cavils) is this, that they conſider not the ſuperexcellency of the Divine being; but meaſure it by the ſhort and ſcanty rules whereby they meaſure the creature. It is true, in things here below, that according to thoſe naturall cauſes wherby everie thing is brought forth; ſo may it likewiſe bring forth the like: becauſe that ſtrength or power is given thereto, for the propagation and preſervation of kinde in the like, which it cannot uphold in it ſelfe; by reaſon of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, neither is the generation of natural things but with imperfection; and their multiplication by deciſion of naturall things but with imperfection; and their multiplication by deciſion of the ſeed into divers parts. Neither doth any father communicate his whole being to that which is begotten by him, neither can the ſpecies or common nature (ſo farre forth as it is multiplicable even by one alone) be ſaved whole and entire any one individuall. But nothing of all this is in the moſt glorious ſpirituall and divine generation: for that power of generation is not received, but eſſentiall; ſo that which is begotten, is eternall
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:107656:57"/>and incorruptible. The generation alſo is in the uttermoſt perfection, becauſe the whole infinite being is communicate thereby: but that not for any abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the principle, but becauſe of the infinite perfection thereof. Neither is matier for multiplication, either poſſible, or needfull here; becauſe all the fulneſſe of Fatherhood, Sonneſhip, and proceſſion are herein perfectly, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially, infinitely, and eternally; becauſe the proceſſion is not ſuch as tends to any thing without: for ſo that which proceedeth ſhould not bee coequall to the principle from whence it doth proceed. But this proceſſion is in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine being onely, in every Perſon according to his peculiar ſubſiſtence, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable whereto, no generation can be found in all the creatures.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Another objection there is to the like purpoſe out of <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. where it is ſaid of the ſecond Perſon, that hee ſuſteineth all things by the Word of his power. So that if hee being the <hi>Word</hi> of his Father, have alſo a <hi>Word</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he ſuſteineth all things, which therefore is another <hi>Word,</hi> and not the things that are ſuſteined thereby: it may ſeeme that there is a multiplication of Perſons, and that the former objection is not fully anſwered. I have ſaid, <hi>Log. Chap.</hi> 29. <hi>n.</hi> 5. That the appointment of all naturall cauſes to the bringing forth of their effects, is the rule or law of Nature. Now this law is that neceſſitie, fate, or deſtinie which is ordained by his eternall decree that made Nature, and all things therein, and bleſſed all the living creature with power to bring forth according to kinde, as it appeares <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. And this is that <hi>Word</hi> of which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes, No other divine Perſon, but that <hi>Word</hi> whereby he melteth the yce, and Snow, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.18. that ordinance which the creature cannot paſſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148.6. Of which you may reade every where in the Holy text, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in that admirable booke of naturall and Divine Philoſophie, the booke of <hi>Iob,</hi> in compariſon of which all <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> naturalls are not worth the while. For ſeeing all naturall cauſes have their ſtrength from him, hath not hee bound nature within thoſe limits, beyond which hee gave it no further power to worke? And within which hee is trulie ſaid to worke by his word, or by his power, in the ſtrength of which alone, Nature her ſelfe doth worke.</p>

                              <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He puritie, or uttermoſt ſimplicitie of the Divine being, is the fountaine from whence all the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which are therein, doe flowe: for neither can any thing be living, powerfull, wiſe, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall, glorious, &amp;c. except it bee: neither can any thing be ſuch infinitely, if it have not an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite being: but an infinite of being cannot be but with the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſimplicitie of being. For whatſoever is put to being, takes
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:107656:57"/>away the ſimplicitie thereof, and muſt needs be a limitation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and ſo take away the infinitie alſo. The manifold perfections therefore in the Divine being, are not additions of other beings to make compoſition therein, or to take away the ſimplicitie thereof, ſeeing they all ſignifie one and the ſame being; but becauſe the moſt ſimple being muſt needs bee the firſt of beings, as being altogether in act or perfection, and no way in poſſibilitie of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: for then were it not a moſt ſimple being, if it were both in act of being that which it is, and in poſſibilitie of being that which it is not: therefore muſt all other beings depend hereon; nay bee herein: becauſe all things are virtually contained in their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. And this is that eternitie of the creature which it had in the infinite wiſdome and power of God before it was, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.5. For ſeeing that in God is infinite perfection, and that nothing can bee wanting to that which is perfect; neither yet can any thing be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect but in him: therefore the firſt and higheſt being of all things muſt bee in his perfection. But becauſe abſolute perfection muſt needs bee with the uttermoſt ſimplicitie, without otherneſſe or change: therefore muſt all things in God bee one, and he though one alone, yet virtually all things. But becauſe all things were in him eternally one; that they might in time bee different in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, (for otherwiſe they could never at all, either have beene, or have beene different) It is neceſſarie to grant, that in that one abſolute being which the creature had in God, there muſt be firſt a poſſibilitie for it to be in it ſelfe: for as things utterlie impoſſible can never be; ſo can there bee no poſſibilitie of being but by him. Secondly, a poſſibilitie for the things being to be different among themſelves, and that not onely in their ſeverall kindes, but alſo in their particular exiſtences; and this for the manifeſtation of that manifold wiſdome of the Maker. And from hence thirdly ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds that actuall being, which things that are being have, by that Holy pleaſure or will, by which they are, and continue in their ſeverall beings: which Will muſt needs bee partaker both of the infinite power, and infinite wiſdome; that it might effect that which was poſſible, and foreſeene. And thus is there in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the creature, a Trinitie alſo in poſſibilitie, in difference, and actuall being; that wee ſhould never forget to adore the eternall Trinitie in the Unitie.</p>
                           <p>But the queſtion of the worlds eternitie, is onely about this laſt manner of actuall being: for it is not denyed that it is eternall in reſpect of that being which it had in God, as the cauſe; or in it ſelfe, as poſſible to bee: becauſe that while it was not being, it had not any power to reſiſt that Almightineſſe, which called it out of not being into being; though to ſpeake more properlie, that eternity which it had in pure poſſibilitie, was not in it ſelfe, becauſe it was not: and ſeeing that which any thing hath of it ſelfe is firſt therein, and more proper thereto than that which it hath of another: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:107656:58"/>the world of it ſelfe having not being, it could not poſſible bee eternall, but onely in his eternall purpoſe which had appointed it unto this being. The World therefore in God, the principle, is not begun, but eternall, and one: but whatſoever is ſevered from this Principle, can neither bee one, nor yet eternall, but comes into the reckoning of otherneſſe and change, and ſo of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie muſt bee ſubject to time, wherein alone all change is wrought.</p>
                           <p>§2. 1. But here it will be asked, whether God who before the creation of the world reſted eternallie in his owne glorie and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, ſuffered not ſome alteration in this, that he wrought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out himſelfe that which hee had not wrought before, and how hee can be ſaid both to worke and to reſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.2 and yet to bee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all ſhadow of change <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.17.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Then how He infinite in goodneſſe and truth, and ever one in himſelfe, ſubjected the creature to wretchedneſſe, continuall corruption and change.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Thirdly, ſeeing that to an infinite and eternall power all things are alwayes poſſible; why the world was not brought forth many ages heretofore; that ſeeing it muſt be ſubject to vanity, it might before this have beene freed from corruption, and brought to that libertie whereto it doth yeare, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.22.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. To the firſt I anſwer; that, although the creature doth of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie ſuppoſe a Creator, without which it could not be, yet on Gods part there was no neceſſitie to enforce him to create; but he created onely according to the pleaſure of his owne will, as it is confeſſed <hi>Revel.</hi> 4.11. For nothing was able to impoſe neceſſitie, but onelie that which was ſuperiour in dignitie and power, which the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excellencie of the Divine being ſuffers not; neither can the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of an infinite will, ſuch as the will of God is, bee guided ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by chance, by deſtinie, or by neceſſitie. But becauſe hee is infinite in goodneſſe, he envied not to any thing the being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but out of not being brought it into being, by his <hi>Word</hi> our <hi>Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Athanaſius de Incarnat. Verbi.</hi> But in this creation he ſuffered no alteration, who had eternally wil'd the creature to be in the time appointed, and in the time appointed brought it out, only by the motion of his will: for his will, his wiſdome, &amp; his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er being infinite and one being, no other motion, labour or alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration needed, but onely to will that the creature ſhould then bee created, when hee had from all eternitie willed that it ſhould bee created. So then it was in him both to create, that it might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that hee had no neceſſitie of the creature, who was abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perfect without it, and yet at his pleaſure to create; leſt that which was not, might ſeeme to be exempted from his power: and againe, that the creature might be bleſſed in his goodneſſe, and yet he himſelfe without all ſhadow of change. As the minde of a man, which hath plotted a convenient houſe, and given or deſcribed
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:107656:58"/>the model to the builder; ſuffers no alteration by the houſe being builded. Therefore after the commandement of water, the firſt matier of all things to bee: the labour of the Creator mentioned in the ſixe dayes, was onely the appointment of ſecondarie cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to worke in their times, to thoſe ends which hee had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, for the bringing forth of their ſeverall effects: for as the firſt agent moves all ſecondarie agents; ſo it is neceſſarie that all their ends bee ordered to the ends of their firſt mover. So then the ſixe Evenings of the being of things, firſt potentially in their immediate or next cauſes; and in the <hi>fieri,</hi> or way to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Mornings of their actuall and perfect being, are the times<note n="*" place="margin">See Eſay <hi>66.8.</hi>
                              </note> ages or dayes wherein they were brought forth by their naturall cauſes, all moving in the power of the firſt cauſe, unto their perfection appointed by his eternall decree. And this ordering of cauſes, and giving ſtrength thereto, was his firſt worke: as his continuall bleſſing and upholding the creature by his word, is his continuall worke wherein hee takes delight. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. <hi>&amp; Pſal.</hi> 104.31. But his reſt in the ſeventh day, was his cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to bring forth new creatures; which day is therefore ſaid not to have any evening, becauſe his reſt, delight, or glorie is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall: and is therefore commanded to bee ſanctified by us with a <hi>Memento,</hi> becauſe it is a pledge unto us, that after the ſixe ages of this worlds travell and wearineſſe in vaine, we ſhall at laſt be made partakers of his reſt. Compare herewith <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. to <hi>ver.</hi> 4. <hi>Eſay</hi> 46.10. and 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.8. But this is beſide my purpoſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I leave it.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. To the ſecond queſtion of that ill which is in the creature, though I have anſwered ſufficiently <hi>note (a) on Chap.</hi> 6. yet I ſay fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that contraries are beſt knowne one by another: light by dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; health by ſickneſſe. And therefore, that we may not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie deſire, but alſo better know and enjoy our future happineſſe; it is fit that wee ſhould taſte the momentary wretchedneſſe and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of this life; yea drinke at laſt the <hi>gar-ans</hi> of death it ſelfe, that wee may truly enjoy the happineſſe of everlaſting life. <hi>O death! how bitter is the remembrance of thee to a man that hath reſt with his poſſeſsions? But how acceptable is thy doome to him that is vexed in all things? Eccles.</hi> 41.1. And queſtionleſſe, if the elect Angels never had any experience of ſorrow; neither did at any time ſinne (for he found no ſtedfaſtneſſe in his ſervants, and laid folly vpon his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. <hi>Iob.</hi> 4.18. And in his beloved Sonne alone is hee well pleaſed. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.17.) Then doe they wonderfully by our afflictions enjoy their owne happineſſe while they dayly behold our manifold miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and yet know us to be heires of equall glorie, <hi>Luke</hi> 20.36. for therfore are the ſons of David dayly ſcourged with the rods of men, corrected every morning, and die at laſt, that they may be like unto their Lord, &amp; be made conformable unto his death: for if the Prince of our ſalvation was conſecrated in afflictions; how ſhould we hope
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:107656:59"/>for any portion in his glorie; if we ſhould not with joy be partakers of his ſufferings? For therefore by his owne example did he teach us obedience, becauſe in obedience onely we muſt walke the way to everlaſting life. A ſecond reaſon is, that wee may be humbled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him when we conſider whereto we are come of our ſelves, that is, into miſerie, but not out; and conſequently that wee may bee thankefull for that abundant grace, by which wee are delivered, when our ſufferings ſhall bee recompenſed with an exceeding weight of glorie.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. The third doubt concerning the time of the worlds creation hath heretofore ſo troubled ſome mens braines, that they thought there had beene infinite worlds, yet ſo, that after everie ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeers all things returne againe to the ſame ſtate wherein they had been before: for whether through the weakenes or ſtrength of the imagination, in ſome fore-catchings of the ſhadowes of things to come, (for it may bee argued both wayes) a man oftentimes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades himſelfe, that hee hath beene in the ſame place, with the ſame perſons, ſeene or done the ſame things, heard or ſpoken the ſame words before; upon which ground it ſeemes this <hi>Pythagorean</hi> fancy was builded. But to the doubt I anſwer: That it would have beene as great, if the world had been made ten thouſand times the whole age of the world before and no greater, if it ſhould have been made as much after the preſent age: for as if you ſuppoſe an infinite ſpace; whereſoever you ſhall ſet a pricke or point therein, it muſt needs be in the middes thereof: ſo time, how long ſoever, yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to eternity, can be no more then as an indiviſible centre there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. And therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> takes up this queſtion <hi>Act.</hi> 17.26. That God hath aſſigned the ſeaſons which were ordayned before, and hee that puts not all things in his power, to do both what he will, and as he will, and when he will, denies him to be God. Now let us ſee the reaſons for the Chriſtian faith, that <hi rend="sup">b</hi> the world is not eternall or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting, but made by Almighty God, as the Article affirmes.</p>
                           <p>§ 3. By the world you can underſtand no other thing, than this frame of the whole being of things (beſide the Godhead) whether heavenly or earthly, underſtanding, bodily, or mixt; ethereall, or elementall; with all the cauſes, and effects, proprieties, actions, or other actions that belong to everie one of them. But the word <hi>Eternall</hi> ſignifies diverſlie. For our purpoſe, either it may meane an age or ſtate of long continuance, as the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed for an eternall or everlaſting poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.8. which eternitie muſt be limited, either to that age of the world before <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or at the fartheſt to the uttermoſt age and time of this world, after the deſolation determined ſhall bee ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, and they brought to their owne land againe. And this muſt needs bee the uttermoſt eternitie of that promiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the letter, as of the everlaſting Covenant of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion. Another taking of eternitie may bee in that being which
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:107656:59"/>hath a beginning and no ending, as our hope is of the ſtate of the ſoule, and everlaſting or eternall life after the reſurrection. So the promiſe of the everlaſting poſſeſſion of <hi>Canaan,</hi> was a type and Promiſe that heaven ſhould bee our eternall inheritance; whereof we have already aſſurance, yea deliverie, and ſeiſure, in that the <hi>Canaanite</hi> the devill is driven out from thence by <hi>Ieſus</hi> our uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Captaine <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12.7, 8. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A third and chiefe meaning of eternitie, is that which hath neither beginning nor ending. And ſo we ſay that God onely is eternall. In the firſt ſignification the world is eternall in that ſtate wherein it is, and hath conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued from the creation, which wee hold, and ſo ſhall continue unto the diſſolution, which wee hope for. In the ſecond ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification alſo it may bee ſaid to bee eternall, as concerning the moſt excellent and noble parts thereof; as the Angels and men reſtored from corruption, and in them the ſecond <hi>Ideas</hi> or formes of all the creatures. But the laſt degree of eternitie is utterlie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to the actuall being of the world, and that for theſe reaſons following.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Whatſoever is eternall, muſt alſo bee infinite, both in the being, and the manner of being, becauſe there could bee nothing before it, by which it might receive any kinde of limit or bounds, any defect or leſneſſe of being. But <hi rend="sup">c</hi> the world is not infinite in the being thereof: for it is concluded already <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. that God is infinite, and of infinites there can bee but one. <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. <hi>conſ.</hi> 2. And in the manner of being it cannot bee infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite: for in all things brought forth, there is either quantitie, contrarie to infinitie or time, contrarie to eternitie; there is defect, or failing, by reaſon of corruption and death: there is abatement, or leſning; becauſe that in everie kinde, one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular is not ſo excellent as another in underſtanding, memorie, ſtrength, beauty, continuance, or one vertue or other. Therfore the world is not eternall.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. If the world bee eternall, then eternity muſt either bee the whole eſſence and convertible with the eſſence of the world; or elſe it muſt agree thereto as the eſſentiall forme, or as a propertie, or as a common accident. Eternitie is not the eſſence of the world, for ſo ſhould it belong to everie part thereof eſſentially: for everie part is partaker of the eſſence of the whole. But this is moſt falſe in all experience; neither is it the eſſentiall forme thereof: for even from thence would it follow, that the world were not eternall, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as having matier and forme, it muſt needs preſuppoſe an efficient cauſe, who both created the parts, and diſpoſed the matier: for the forme, it cannot be a propertie thereto: for all properties proceed from the compoſition or joyning together of the matier and forme. But compoſition takes away eternitie for the reaſon aforeſaid, neither is it an accident, nor yet appropriate thereto by accident, as any relation: for all ſuch, by the order of nature, are after
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:107656:60"/>that ſubject whereto they belong; whether they be immediate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, or relations depending thereupon. Therefore the world in the actuall being is no way eternall.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Whatſoever hath parts muſt needs bee compounded, and whatſoever is compounded or put together muſt needs have parts that were once aſunder, and ſo cannot bee eternall <hi>à parte ante.</hi> And againe everie compound, by that power whereby it was made, may be reſolved into thoſe parts of which it was made, whether the parts bee eſſentiall, as body and ſoule to a man; or entyre, as ſtones, timber, iron, glaſſe, &amp;c. to a houſe. But the World hath parts ethereall, elementall, incorruptible, and corruptible, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall, vegetable, minerall, &amp;c. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the World is not eternall.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. All reall truth is verified, firſt in the things of actuall being, that is, in the individuals. Secondly, in the notions or apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the things in their intentionall or common being, either ſpeciall, or more generall. But if the world be eternall, that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity can agree onely to the common being, and not to the particular or individuall beings, as to this man, that horſe, that tree, &amp;c. So the truth of the worlds eternity, ſhall be intentionall onely, not reall: ſo common intentions onely may bee true, where there is no individuall. But this is moſt falſe and impoſſible: therefore it is moſt falſe that the world is eternall.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. The whole World, conſiſting of all the parts thereof, is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a body, or not a body. If our ſence (from whence all our diſcourſe proceeds) be judge, it is a body. Now every body in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the extent thereof, is finite, is of parts which may bee meaſured, either one by another in halfs, quarters, &amp;c. or elſe by common meaſures, of inches, yards, myles, pints, gallons, &amp;c. It hath likewiſe ſhape or figure, and dimenſion, by length, bredth, depth, without which it could not be a body. But if the world be eternall; then muſt it bee both finite it regard of the extenſion, and infinite in the continuance: ſo infinitie ſhall be more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in a forrein ſubject, that is, in continuance to make it infinite, then it can be in it owne proper ſubject, that is, in meaſure to make it unlimited: ſo alſo infinitie ſhall bee powerfull in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietie of good and ill, to make them eternall, and weake in the littleneſſe of extenſion. So alſo the world being eternall, muſt be for this end, that it may bee that which it is as God. Whereby it would follow that the end of the worlds being could not bee one, but contrarie to it ſelfe in generation and corruption, in good and ill; and all other contrarieties, that are now therein. But all theſe things are impoſſible: therefore the contrary is neceſſary, <hi>See Log. Cap.</hi> 26. <hi>n.</hi> 1.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. Eternitie cannot admit before and after, ſo that one eternall ſhould be before another eternall. But if the world be eternall, this muſt follow neceſſarilie: for every generation is with the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or taking away of that forme which was in the matier before;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:107656:60"/>and every corruption is of ſomething that was generate before: So each of theſe eternals muſt bee each before another, and ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them eternall, and yet the eternity of the world brings in theſe contradictions, inaſmuch as generation and corruption have beene ever ſince the world was. Therefore the worlds eternity is impoſſible.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. If the world be eternall, that eternity ſhall be rather ill, than good; becauſe the longer the continuance of the world is, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the encreaſe of wickedneſſe and ill, more than of that which is good: at leaſt becauſe of the continuance of good and ill, the worlds eternitie ſhall be both good and ill. And yet becauſe every worldly good hath a beginning and an end in time, and that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry privation or taking away of any good eternally, muſt needs be an eternall ill: that eternity of the world ſhall bee neerer to ill than to good, both becauſe of the poſitive ills, and the deprivations of the goodneſſes that are therein. Moreover ſeeing nothing which is corrupted returnes to be the ſame in number, which it was before; generation ſhall bee good and availeable to the maintenance of the ſpecies onely, not to the reſtoring of the actuall or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuall Beings: But Corruption ſhall bee powerfull both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the individuall, and therein againſt the ſpecies alſo. And ſo the worlds eternity ſhall bee much nearer to ill than to good, and a bringing in of all theſe inconveniences. Therefore it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. If the world be eternall, then neither was there any firſt man, neither can there be any laſt: without which laſtneſſe there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be any generall reſurrection of men, nor place to containe them. So this eternity of the world muſt be the greateſt ill, as being that which brings in an impoſſibility of the greateſt good, that is, the hope of the reſurrection and everlaſting life, the end of all our hopes. But it is impoſſible that this hope of man ſhould bee fruſtrate, as it will appeare further in the 38. <hi>chap.</hi> Therefore the world is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. And if you looke backe on the things that have beene already ſpoken concerning the dignities of the Godhead, in the nine firſt chapters, you may from thence make a great ſupply of arguments to this purpoſe, thus; God is, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. And He is being eſſentially, with all the perfection of being infinitely, eternally, actually; not in poſſibility of being any thing that hee is not, and therefore God is the perfection of being: and convertible the perfection of being is God. Now termes convertible cannot poſſibly belong to forrein beings: as to guide a ſhippe at Sea, cannot belong to any but to man alone. Therefore being cannot belong to any thing but to God alone, primarily and of it ſelfe, but onely Analogical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as it hath received the Being from Him. Therefore if the world be not God, which the foole cannot ſay in his heart, the world is not eternall.</p>
                           <pb n="90" facs="tcp:107656:61"/>
                           <p n="10">10. God is eternall, <hi>chap.</hi> 2. and eternity belongs eſſentially to God alone, <hi>chap.</hi> 8. If then the world be not God; then can it not be coeternall with Him. For as it is not poſſible that there ſhould bee more Gods, <hi>chap.</hi> 8. <hi>n.</hi> 7. ſo it is not poſſible that there ſhould bee more eternals than one. Therefore the world is not eternall. So you may reaſon from the ſimplicity of His being proved, <hi>chap.</hi> 9. <hi>n.</hi> 6.7. and from the other dignities of God which are proved to belong to Him in the chapter before; &amp; no leſſe from thoſe things which are denyed to belong to Him, as to bee matier, bodily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded; &amp;c. <hi>chap.</hi> 9. But in this plenty and plainneſſe of the matier I take onely that one which followeth.</p>
                           <p n="11">11. If God bee almighty and one: then it is not poſſible, that any thing can be but by his power alone. But it hath beene pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that God is almighty, <hi>chap.</hi> 6. and one, <hi>chap.</hi> 8. <hi>n.</hi> 7. Therefore the world is by his power alone. But if it be obiected, that by his eternall power, hee brought out the world eternally; yet muſt it needs bee, that hee created it, either of nothing; or of ſome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier that was not eternall; or elſe that hee made it of a matier that was eternall. To ſay that God from all eternity had created the world, either of nothing; or of a matier not eternall, would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a manifeſt contradiction. To ſay that hee made it of a matier which was coeternall to himſelfe, would enforce that the world were conſubſtantiall with God; or rather that it were God. For ſeeing his being is moſt ſimple and one entyre being, without parts, and is not communicated, but whole and all, and that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity (as all his other attributes) was proved to be God eſſentially, it cannot bee but that the world muſt be God, if it be eternall. Or if that impoſſibility could be avoyded; yet to ſay that God had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally made the world of eternall matier, would neceſſitate him to an action without himſelfe, which would take away the infinite freedome of his will, his glory, and perfection, which hee hath in himſelfe. Or if it bee ſaid, that the world is eternall without or beſide any action of God upon it, but of it ſelfe alone, beſide the endleſſe abſurdities, contradictions, and impoſſibilities that would follow thereby; It would directly enforce, that there is no God. For if the power by which the world is, and workes; if the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome manifeſt in the ordering cauſes therein; if the truth, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, continuance, and other attributes of worldly things, had any other originall than God; then muſt it of neceſſity follow, that God is not infinite in theſe dignities of power, wiſdome, truth, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, goodneſſe, &amp;c. when ſo great effects of theſe things are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without Him. And to deny unto God the infinity or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of theſe dignities, were utterly to deny his Being, and to make him unworthy to bee that which Hee is, contrary to all that hath heretofore beene proved.</p>

And then to ſee whether the creation of the world doe belong to every Perſon of the Trinity alike, or to any one more particularly than another.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, it is certaine, that not being cannot be the beginning of Being. And therefore it is neceſſarie that Being bee eternall. And that which is the firſt of beings muſt needs be the cauſe of al thereſt: So that all other beings muſt acknowledge their originall from thence. And becauſe all things that are, were in time created by that firſt of Beings, not according to any neceſſity of naturall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; as the fire according to the neceſſitie thereof, doth burne any matier that is fit to be burnt; but only according to the pleaſure of his owne will: therefore firſt of all it muſt neceſſarily enſue hereof, that the continuance of all things muſt have the ſame cauſe, which was alſo of their Being. So that for his holy wills ſake alone they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo continue. If he then withdraw his ſupportance either from all, or from any particular creature, it muſt of neceſſity come to nought in an inſtant.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, becauſe every agent workes for ſome end: and the greateſt and beſt of work-maſters muſt needs work for the greateſt and chiefeſt good; and ſeeing there neither is, nor can be any thing greater or better than God himſelfe; Therefore it is neceſſary, that this world was created for Him. But becauſe Hee, infinitely bleſſed in Himſelfe, needed not the world, nor any thing of the world, as though he could be better thereby <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.2. <hi>Act.</hi> 17.25. it muſt follow; that the creature was for this end; that as by his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it was made partaker of being, ſo by his infinite goodneſſe it might alſo bee partaker of glory and happineſſe.For becauſe his
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:107656:62"/>goodneſſe, and life and happineſſe, and all his glories are anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his owne being; therefore are they infinitely ſufficient for every thing, that in any ſort can poſſibly be partaker of being. So then the goodneſſe of God was not encreaſed in the creation, but manifeſted onely; that the creature, according to the meaſure thereof, might bee bleſſed in him. Thus then is God the end of all the creature; Becauſe hee is that ſuperſupreme perfection of goodneſſe, and happineſſe whereof the whole creature deſires to be partaker: but that not out of any choice or purpoſe of the creature; but of him alone that hath created it to be partaker of that image of his goodneſſe.</p>
                           <p>From the firſt concluſion we are taught with what reverence and feare we ought to live before him; to whoſe onely pleaſure we owe our being and continuance. Next with what great reſpect and care we ought to behave our ſelves toward the creature; not onely men which have the ſame pretious hopes of immortality which wee have; but likewiſe toward every other creature, even the leaſt of Beings. For although we know that all the more bodily creature was made for the uſe of that which hath underſtanding; and that not onely for the exerciſe of the minde in his wiſdome and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that created it; but for thankefullneſſe alſo to that goodneſſe which hath ſubjected it to our uſe in food, in clothing, and other ſuch ſervices for our eaſe, or conveniences; that being deſtitute of no good thing, wee might give ourſelves to his ſervice, and praiſe him alone: And laſtly, that the whole creature might bee bleſſed in man, in whom it is to poſſeſſe an eternall being: yet when wee remember, that there is nothing ſo meane, or ſeeming ſo baſe in the Creature, but that it was eternally foreſeene to that infinite wiſdome even as we; that it was created by the ſame power, appointed by the ſame foreknowledge to this or that very uſe; with what reverence and feare ſhould we carry ourſelves leſt we abuſe it, and ſo offer diſhonour unto the Lord and owner both of it, and us alike? eſpecially ſeeing that when we were not, hee had determined ſo to bleſſe us.</p>
                           <p>From the ſecond concluſion wee may learne with what pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence wee ought to endure all the troubles and afflictions of this life; becauſe wee know thoſe pretious promiſes whereto wee are crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if we acknowledge Him faithfull, and hold our hopes unto the end, ſee <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2.</p>
                           <p>The queſtion moved, to which Perſon the Creation belongs, is full of perplexity, and of any other moſt hard and darke, if it bee well thought on. And therefore in the ſolution thereof it is moſt ſafe for us to hearken to the oracles of God alone. It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly and truely ſaid, that the workes of the Holy Trinitie which are without are undivided; yet ſo as that they receive a certaine determination or order from that manner of Being which is in the Perſons. And therefore becauſe the Father is the fountaine of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:107656:62"/>they commonly aſcribe the creation or bringing of things into being unto Him. So becauſe all perfection of Sonſhip is in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Perſon, and that there can be no moe Sonnes than one: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the redemption of mankinde by the in-dwelling of God in Man is given unto the Sonne, and ſo the ſanctifying of the church to the Holy Ghoſt. But if wee looke diligently unto the text of the Holy Scripture, we ſhall finde how neceſſary it was that the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator ſhould ſatisfie for the ſinne of the creature, becauſe the whole creature, was made by Him. For ſo wee may reade <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.2.3. All things were made by that word which in the beginning was with God, And without it was nothing made which was made. And <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. He was in the world, and the world was made by him. And <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. And that word was made fleſh, (that is, tooke on him the whole nature of man, body and ſoule) and dwelt among us, and we ſaw on the holy mount, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.2. &amp;c. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. the glory thereof, that is, of that fleſh or man, as the glory of the only begotten Sonne of the Father. And againe <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16. By him that is the Sonne were all things created which are in heaven, and which are in earth: things viſible, and inviſible, all things were created by him, and for him, and in him all things conſiſt. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.6. There is one God the Father, of whom were all things, and we by him. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.9. God hath created all things by <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 1.2. God hath ſpoken unto us in theſe laſt dayes by his Sonne, whom He hath made heire of all things: by whom alſo he made the worlds. By all which texts it is cleere which S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.36. of him, through him, and for Him are all things. That is, that God the deliverer, which ſhould come out of Sion, <hi>verſ.</hi> 26. And thus have theſe Apoſtles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained that which is written. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1. In the beginning <hi>Elohim</hi> cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated heaven and earth, which word in the whole body of the old Teſtament (as wiſemen have obſerved) is almoſt never ſpoken but of the Perſon of the Mediator onely. I ſuppoſe then that it is plaine enough, which is ſpoken by our Lord, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 19. The Sonne can doe nothing of Himſelfe ſave what he ſeeth the Father doe: for whatſoever things He doth, the ſame things doth the Sonne in like manner. That is, whatſoever the eternall Godhead ordeined in his everlaſting Counſell and decree to bee done, that ſame doth the Sonne execute and performe in the creature anſwerably, and brings forth every thing in time according to the poſſibilities and opportunities of the creature. For as the wiſeman ſaith, <hi>Ecclus.</hi> 18.1. <hi>He that liveth for ever made all things together, or at once.</hi> So the Pſalmiſt, as alſo the other Scriptures, tels us by whom and in whom, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.24. <hi>In wiſdome haſt thou made them all, that is</hi> in our Creator and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. So then, it being cleered by the text of the holy Scripture that the creation of the world was of God the Father in <hi>Chriſt, by Chriſt and for Chriſt;</hi> it will eaſily follow how neceſſary it was that He our creator by His eternall Spirit ſhould offer himſelfe to God for the ſin of his creature, as it will further appeare when I come to that article.</p>

                              <hi>(b) The world is not eternall.]</hi> The moſt famouſed opinions that have beene concerning the worlds eternity, are theſe. One, that which the Chriſtian faith doth hold, according to the truth of the holy oracles of God, and the voice of Reaſon, as you have heard: and to this truth the Stoicks are ſaid to haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented. The ſecond opinion is that of <hi>Plato,</hi> and his followers, who held that the world had a beginning in time, but of an eternall matier, and that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance thereof ſhould bee eternall. For ſeeing generation and corruption is onely by the change of formes, the matier ſtill remaining one: therefore they thought, that as that forme which is purely without matier was incorruptible and eternall; So likewiſe muſt matier bee, which of it owne nature is utterly without forme. And becauſe matier is greedy of all formes how differing or contrary ſoever; Therefore it is ever ſubject to change. Neither is the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it ſelfe utterly freed from all power of Change, becauſe of that matier whereof it is, in which the power of Change is ever hidde. Therefore the world is not eternall in reſpect of any power in it ſelfe, either to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of formes or the continuance of it ſelfe under the ſame formes: but firſt in reſpect of the vnformed matier, and moſt of all in reſpect of that Spirit or life, whereby it is guided and ordered; as by the internall cauſes: and in reſpect of the divine will, and goodneſſe, as the outward principle, and the end: which will as it cannot repent to have done good in giving being unto the world, and the things therein contained; ſo can it not will contrary to it ſelfe, and ceaſe to doe good in the continuance of the creature in that being which it hath. You may reade more to his purpoſe in <hi>Plot. Ennead.</hi> 2. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentator, <hi>Marſilius Ficinus.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The third opinion is that of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that the world was eternall, and from God, as an eternall effect of an eternall cauſe. For becauſe it ſeemed to him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible (and if you looke no higher than nature alone, it is indeed impoſſible) that any thing being can come out of nothing: therefore matier muſt needs be eternall, and therewith generation and corruption, without which nothing is brought forth; And becauſe theſe two could not be thought to be without the moving of the heavens, as the cauſe thereof, therefore both the heavenly bodies and motion, eſpecially circular, muſt be alſo eternall; and herewith time, which is meaſured by the motion of the heavens.</p>
                           <p>But what this eternall matier ſhould bee, the Philoſophers went into divers opinions. <hi>Heraclitus</hi> thought it to be fire: <hi>Archelaus</hi> ayre; <hi>Empedocles</hi> all the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and among the reſt, one, one thing; and another, another; as you may reade in <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> where hee refutes them: in <hi>Tull.

But the opinions of the leſſe reckoning are thoſe that are found amongſt the heretickes of the Chriſtians, For all the Philoſophers and Poets of the heathen, which held not the eternity of the world, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged God the authour of the world under one name or other: but <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and with him <hi>Menander,</hi> ſaid that the Angels were the makers of the world. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnius</hi> gives the honour unto ſeven Angels alone, whom he makes the Creators of the world, without the conſent or knowledge of God. <hi>Carpocrates,</hi> and the <hi>Priſcillianiſts</hi> affirmed, that the world was made by certaine inferiour Angels, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom the devill was chiefe workemaſter. <hi>Valentinus</hi> gave it out, that a devil which was begotten of the thirtieth <hi>Aion</hi> begot other devils, and theſe Sonnes of <hi>Aveugles</hi> made the world; and miſchiefe, and ſinne are in the world, not through the wickedneſſe and free will of man, but even by the very creation of the world it ſelfe. The <hi>Nicholaitanes</hi> tel us, of Angels the makers of the world; and that <hi>Barbelo,</hi> who was ruler of the eight Sphere, was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeer of the works, His mothers name was <hi>Yaldaboth.</hi> But I have not read ſo farre in heraldry, as to tell you who was his Dad, nor of what houſe his mother came, nor yet whether his follow workemen were good or bad Angels. The <hi>Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks</hi> of the two Gods which they make (as you have heard before) make the ill God the creator of the world; which though it appeare not, either by <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus, Clement, Tertullian, Epiphanius,</hi> or by <hi>S. Auguſtine;</hi> yet it is plaine by <hi>Plo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus, Aenead.</hi> 2. <hi>lib.</hi> 9. who writes againſt their opinions, and this in particular. <hi>Marcion</hi> made three creators: one good, another bad, and another betweene them, whom they called Iuſt. So you ſee how all theſe hereticks had madded
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:107656:64"/>themſelves and their followers, in their opinions concerning the Creator of all things. Others erred concerning ſome parts of the creature onely; as the <hi>Seleucians,</hi> and <hi>Hermians</hi> or <hi>Hermogenians,</hi> beſide their errour of the worlds matier coeternall with God, denyed that God created the ſoules of men, but would have them created by the Angels of fyer and Spirit; contrary to that which is In <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.7. &amp; <hi>Eſay</hi> 57.16. &amp; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.9. That God is the faithfull Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the ſoule. The <hi>Priſcillianiſts</hi> ſaid that the ſoules of men were of the ſame ſubſtance and nature with God; and being by him ſent downe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the devill met with them by the way, and ſowed them as ſeed in the fleſh: whereupon it muſt follow, either that the being of God is diviſible into infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite partes; or that there is but one onely ſoule of all men; and both wayes unavoydably, that God (at leaſt in part of Himſelfe) muſt be ſubject to Sinne; and ſo that either He muſt need a Saviour; or by His owne law, bee ſubject to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall death. This is the fruite of hereſie. The <hi>Patricians</hi> denyed God to be the Creator of the body of man, and gave that honour to the devill; contrary to that which is in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 7. and <hi>v.</hi> 21.22. yea, and ſo deteſted the fleſh, as that to be out of the body, ſome of them killed themſelves. The <hi>Paternians</hi> ſaid that the lower parts of the body, (it ſeemes onely thoſe that are affixed thereto for ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations ſake, that fleſh which the law ſo often commands to be waſhed) were made by the devil, and thereupon tooke occaſion to live in filthineſſe, and Iuſt, contrary to the Commandement of God. The <hi>Marcionites,</hi> and <hi>Manichees</hi> ſaid, that wickedneſſe and ill, was partly from God, and partly from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier of the world. <hi>Florinus</hi> and his followers ſaid, that things were created ill, according to their ſubſtances; contrary to the Scripture, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.31. But contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, the <hi>Coluthians</hi> would not have God the Author of ill; no not that of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: which nevertheleſſe the Scripture teaches <hi>Eſay</hi> 45.7. and 54.16. <hi>Amos.</hi> 3.6. Some alſo of the heretickes followed the opinions of the ancient Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers; as they that were called <hi>Aquei,</hi> that of <hi>Thales;</hi> and ſaid that water was the matier of the would, but yet eternall, and not created. The <hi>Audian</hi> and <hi>Manichean</hi> hereticks inſtead of <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> eternals, brought in darkeneſſe, fire, and water; you might bring hither their fooliſh thoughts concerning the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plantation of ſoules, and ſuch like queſtions: but there will bee fitter place thereto in the article of everlaſting life. And becauſe theſe upſtart weenings are ſo witleſſe, as they are falſe; I will not vouchſafe to inquire into their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: the onely authority of the holy Scripture is ſufficient to grinde them all to duſt; and to bring that duſt to nought at all. But leaſt any man contrary to the truth of God, be overſwayed with the reaſons of the Philoſophers, it will not be unfit to examine, and anſwer them.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. And firſt concerning the reaſons of the <hi>Platonicks,</hi> that the matier of the world ſhould therefore be eternall, becauſe it is ſimple, and uncompounded. I anſwer, That it is but <hi>petitio principii;</hi> or a taking of that which is not granted: for it is utterlie denied that there was ever ſuch matier as they ſuppoſe, utterly informed. I ſay according to the <hi>Sacred Philoſophie,</hi> that when water the firſt matier of all things, was created, darkneſſe or confuſion was upon the face of the deepe: but yet with that water, under that confuſion, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created all manner of formes, which afterward were all brought forth out of the poſſibilitie of the matier; ſo that matier was impregnate or great with all kinde of formes, which afterward were made to appeare: for otherwiſe could not the effect bee anſwerable to the cauſe, if hee being in himſelfe the <hi>Jdeas</hi> or formes of all beings, had not brought forth the firſt matier full fraught with all materiall formes, by which afterwards, according to the diſpoſition of their naturall cauſes, the different kindes of things were informed. And therefore here alſo are all things ſaid, by him to have beene made at once. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in the workes of the fifth day, the whales, with other things which
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:107656:64"/>had a life, with the power of moving, are ſaid to bee created; yet is that ſpoken onely in regard of that more manifeſt life than the vegetable had, in the workes of the third day: but that life nevertheleſſe was brought out of the power of the matier by more powerfull cauſes, his bleſſing comming thereto; even as it was afterward upon them to bring forth after their kinde. Onely in the ſixth day, becauſe it was not in the power of all nature to bring forth a reaſonable and an immortall ſoule, hee breathed into man a Spirit of new life, and man became a living ſoule, the epitome or modell of all the creature, earthly and heavenly, bodily and ſpirituall. This truth is ſo plaine, that <hi>Ovid</hi> the prince of all the heathen Poets for wit, judgement and manifold lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, read it in the booke of nature <hi>Metam. lib.</hi> 1.</p>
                           <q>
                              <l>Before the Sea, the earth, and heaven all hiding,</l>
                              <l>There was one face on all the world abiding;</l>
                              <l>Which men name <hi>Chaos;</hi> an unordered load,</l>
                              <l>Wherein the ſeeds of things contrarie aboade.</l>
                           </q>
                           <p>But though it be granted that the firſt matier was meerely and purely ſimple, yet can it not follow that therefore it was eternall, except it may withall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that it had power to bee of it ſelfe, without the power of the Creator. But that would utterlie take away the infinite power of God; if beſide his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, any power could bee ſuppoſed to another thing, which could uphold an eternall being. And ſeeing in all corruption everie thing returnes to thoſe principles of which it was; as in man his body to the earth, and his Spirit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God that gave it, and that nothing materiall returnes to a ſimple and pure being, but that it is ſtill found under ſome forme or other; it is manifeſt, firſt, that that firſt matier was not created ſimple; but by his decree ever ſubject to compoſition: and therefore ſecondly impoſſible to be eternall. Concerning that eternall Spirit or life of the world, in reſpect of which they thought it ſhould bee eternall, both before and after; you ſhall underſtand more in the 24. <hi>Chap. note (g)</hi> § 10. yet in the meane time I anſwer, that if that Spirit whereby the world both is, and is ordered, worke according to that paterne which hee ſees in another; it cannot follow, that the world ſhall thereby bee for ever, except it appeare to ſtand with that will, according to which hee workes. Now what that will is we underſtand better, by his owne <hi>Revelation</hi> in his owne word, than <hi>Plato</hi> and all his followers could ſee in all the ſubtilty of their underſtanding. By which word alſo wee know, that the laſt end and hope of the creature is more excellent and glorious by the change, than by the continuance of the world for ever in that ſtate wherein it is. And thus the ſpeciall reaſons of that Sect are anſwered. See more to this queſtion (if you will) in <hi>Tertullian</hi> againſt <hi>Hermogenes.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="2">2. But it is further objected, that whatſoever begins to worke which did not worke before, muſt be moved thereto, either by it ſelfe, or by another. But God is not moved, that is, changed from that which he was before, either by himſelfe, nor by any other: for neither can his action bee new, or begun, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his action is his being; neither can hee be affected otherwiſe, than hee was before. And therefore is hee an eternall cauſe of the world, an eternall effect, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> affirmed. I anſwer, That no new motion or purpoſe can come unto God concerning the creature: for all his workes are knowne to him from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.18. But ſeeing that theſe workes of which we ſpeake, are of his will alone; they muſt be according to the limitation or appointment of that will: ſo that although hee had eternally willed to create the world; yet had he eternally willed, when, by whom, and after what faſhion, the world and all
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:107656:65"/>the things therein ſhould be created. And this by one onely will and one onely action of the ſame will eternally. The newneſſe then of the world is in the actuall being of the world, not in the will or power whereby it was wrought. But for the better underſtanding of this thing, you may obſerve a difference of actions, of which ſome are immanent, or in-dwelling in the doer and are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted among the perfections of the thing; ſuch are the workes of the will or underſtanding: ſome againe are tranſeunt, or paſſing from the doer upon that which is done; as the worke of the Smith upon the ſteele in making a ſword. The workes of God in himſelfe are immanent; neither doe theſe of neceſſitie put the outward object into actuall being; as a man may conceive of a houſe, which is not yet built; or the Smith by his art or skill hath power to make a locke which hee hath not yet made. So God though hee foreſaw and willed eternally that the world ſhould bee, yet the effect followed not, but according to the determination of that will, when, by whom, and how the world ſhould receive an actuall being.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. But it may againe bee ſaid, that God is an Eternall, and an Almighty agent; and that not in poſſibilitie onely, but in act alſo: for whatſoever is brought from the poſſibilitie of doing unto the act of doing, muſt bee enforced thereto by a former, and more powerfull agent, and that actually, which in God is utterlie impoſſible: and if hee be an eternall and a powerfull agent, and that actually, the effect muſt neceſſarily follow, and that actually: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe neither could the effect be anſwerable to the cauſe; nor yet the cauſe bee ſaid to bee ſufficient and Almightie, if the cauſe were in act, and the effect in poſſibilitie onely: therefore it ſeemes the world muſt of neceſſitie be eternall. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Although God bee actually and eternally whatſoever hee may bee in himſelfe, yet ſeeing hee workes in outward things, not according to any neceſſitie, but onely according to the pleaſure of his owne will; the outward effect of his power muſt bee limited according to the circumſtances of his will, which I declared before. Therefore this reaſon doth no more enforce the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of the world, than it doth that all the poſſibilities of the creature ſhould be actually at once; and that every thing created ſhould bee eternall, becauſe the cauſe is eternall, actuall, and allſufficient. But theſe things as they can no way ſtand with the poſſibilitie of the creature; ſo would they utterly take away the working of all naturall cauſes, by which the glory of his manifold wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is declared: neither doth the all-ſufficiencie of the cauſe bring any ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie to the reaſon to prove the world eternall. For although the creature bee an effect of the infinite power of God; yet becauſe it is not an adequate or proportionable object thereto, that is, wherein that power may bee wholly and onely exerciſed; therefore is it but a forrein effect, wherein that power workes onely according to the will of the worker. Therefore obſerve here ſecondly a difference of agents, of which ſome worke naturally, and theſe worke alwayes neceſſarily according to their uttermoſt power, in the diverſity of things whereon they worke, as the Sunne by his heat melts that which hath thin parts, as butter, or waxe, and hardens that which hath parts more ſtiffe, as clay. Some agents againe are voluntarie, and theſe worke not neceſſarily, but according to the choice and freedome of their owne will; as the Phyſician gives not to his patient all that hee can give, but that which hee knowes to bee with his ſtrength to the procuring of health. Now God is firſt and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall among theſe agents onely, as concerning all things without himſelfe; and no way tyed by any neceſſitie: therefore the world being an effect of the will of God; it muſt be ſubject to all the conditions of that will, that it be ſuch as he will have it, that it be when he will have it, that it bee according to thoſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes by which he will have it, that it bee of that continuance as he will have it, and this unchangeably, becauſe there is no ſuperiour being whereby that will can poſſibly be changed.</p>
                           <pb n="99" facs="tcp:107656:65"/>
                           <p n="4">4. But what God willed he willed, from eternitie, and becauſe his will (as you truly ſay) cannot be changed; therefore no new motion can come thereto, and becauſe no defect can bee therein, nor yet any hinderance, as being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible with an infinite power; therefore it is neceſſarie that the world was created eternally, that his will eternally might take effect. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It is not denied but that the world in the purpoſe of God was willed to bee eternally, and that no change, defect or hinderance was or ever could bee found in this will: for if any of theſe things were not thus; it had beene impoſſible that ever the world ſhould have beene. But yet to put the eternitle of the world, leſt this will ſhould be without effect, would neceſſitate this will to the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all being of the creature; in that it might ſeeme deficient and hindred, and ſo, miſerable; if the creature had not beene eternall: but this by no meanes may be yeelded unto; becauſe it would utterlie take away the abſolute libertie of of an infinite will: for although God doth not, or cannot bee ſaid both to will and unwill the ſame things, in reſpect of the effect of his will, or the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all being of the things themſelves; becauſe hee cannot denie himſelfe, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.13. Yet in regard of any ſuperiour cauſe which might enforce his will to the one ſide, or the other, it cannot bee denied but that hee had abſolute libertie, both to will, or not to will the being of any thing without himſelfe: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe his will were more limited then the will of a man, who hath freedome of will to doe or not to doe the things that are in his owne power; and therefore his will tooke effect in this, neither could it bee effected otherwiſe than thus, that the creature was then when hee had determined that it ſhould bee. But for the better underſtanding and aſſoyling of this doubt, remember this third dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference concerning the neceſſitie of Gods will; which is either abſolute, or conditionall. The abſolute neceſſitie of Gods will is in that which concernes himſelfe alone; as, that hee be, that his being bee ſuch as it is, infinite, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, glorious, &amp;c. The conditionall neceſſitie which they call of ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is of things without himſelfe; as becauſe hee knowes his infinite being ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for ſupportance of all manner of being; his owne goodneſſe to bee like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in finite, and yet loves the multiplicitie of goodneſſe, as the ſimilitude or repreſentation of his owne; therefore wils hee that the creature bee the image of his being and goodneſſe; and although there bee but one action of the will whereby it is carried to the deſire of good; yet becauſe goodneſſe cannot be infinite, but in himſelfe alone; therefore doth hee will his owne being with an abſolute neceſſitie of his will: but hee wils other things as hee hath limited the times of their being, and degrees of their perfection. So that as by one eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall act of knowledge hee knowes both his owne being, and therein all the poſſibilities of being; ſo by one act of his will, which is moved by the ſhew of good, doth he will himſelfe as an infinite, good, with an abſolute neceſſitie of his will, and other things as the repreſEntations of his goodneſſe; which good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is that condition for which hee wils them neceſſarily, <hi>ex ſuppoſito,</hi> I meane, that they may bee partakers of his goodneſſe, not that hee hath need of any of them. So having willed that man ſhould bee, it is neceſſarie that hee will alſo all thoſe things which are neceſſarie to his being; as that hee have a ſoule endued with reaſon, and election, &amp;c. which things though hee willed eternally, and neceſſarily; yet not with any abſolute neceſſitie; becauſe hee is abſolutely perfect in himſelfe without them: therefore as it followes not, that all things poſſible ſhould bee at once, becauſe he is Almightie; ſo neither doth it follow, that any thing created ſhould bee eternall, becauſe hee from eternitie willed that it ſhould be; but rather becauſe he willed that it ſhould be in time, therefore it cannot in any caſe be eternall.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Whatſoever begins to be that which it was not before, muſt needs have the preſent being by ſome kinde of change whereby it was brought to bee that

But before all change it is neceſſarie that there bee ſomething that may be changed; and this may ſeeme to be eternall. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The propoſition is true onely in things that are changed according to naturall cauſes. But creation is a thing above nature; by which nature her ſelfe had her beginning, not onely in regard of the ſubject or matier wherein ſhee workes; but alſo of the cauſes by which ſhe brings forth all naturall effects. But you will ſay, that all things are not materiall: for the ſpirituall beings, of whom it is fit to thinke that they are both moe in number, and in greater differences of eſſentiall formes than the bodily are; yet are not materiall: in which reſpect, not being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to change, they may well be thought eternall. I may anſwer hereto as to the firſt objection from the ſimplicitie of the matier: for firſt, it is not gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the ſpirituall beings ſpoken of, are utterlie without matier: then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that were given; yet it followes not but that they were brought into be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of not being, and ſo created as the Article affirmes. And theſe are the chiefe arguments brought by the <hi>Platonicks</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotelians</hi> to prove the worlds eternitie. Other objections of leſſe importance you may reade (if you will) with their anſwers in <hi>Thomas Aquinas contra Gentes, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 32.33.34. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if you underſtand the anſwers, and the differences which have beene obſerved; I ſuppoſe you ſhall be able thereby to anſwer for the truth.</p>

But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the poſſible combination of letters be ſo different as they make it, yet the reaſon holds not for the actions and paſſions as well as the proprieties of things muſt be expreſſible with all the differences of times, paſt, preſent, and to come, and that either alone, or with others. Beſides, wordes expreſſe the defects of things, the vices alſo and imaginations of the minde, which are neither created beings, nor alwayes true. Moreover although <hi>Adam</hi> had power over all words, yet it appeares not that hee had knowledge alſo of the nature, and differences of the heavenly and ſpirituall creatures; ſo that the words may perhaps fall ſhort of the number of different beings. But becauſe they will not be out bidden, they ſix this number to the combination of conſonants (it ſeemes for the different ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies) to which if you adde the different vowels above or below (as the manner of that writing is) you ſhall have a number ſo great as may equall all the individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, of all the ſpecialls that ever have beene or ſhall bee hereafter: which by <hi>Patricius</hi> muſt needs be infinite: for thus he reaſons, <hi>Panarch. lib.</hi> 19. from three infinities, eſſentiall, potentiall, and actuall, a fourth infinite muſt needs proceed, at leaſt of number: for otherwiſe the effect ſhould not bee anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the cauſe.

Can an infinite Being bring forth an effect without power, and working thereto? or can an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite power bee, but in an infinite being? or can an infinite worke bee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an infinite power? ſo that theſe three which hee makes divers Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and that of ſeverall Trinities, can bee but one Creator, as they are but one Trinity in unity of eſſence, as hath afore beene declared at large. And as concerning the concluſion, it is yeelded that the number of individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als or particular beings is infinite to us, utterly beyond our reckoning: but yet to Him, without whom a Sparrow lights not on the ground, they are all numbred.

And becauſe they are taken as ſuppoſitions in the briefe of our Creed, and ſeeme plaine enough of themſelves; they may be handled with the more ſhortneſſe, but yet may they not here bee let paſſe altogether untouched: for although it be given that man is the creature of God; yet if he made many men, and many women, though one or moe ſinned; yet the reſt might continue in their innocencie, and ſo the whole race of mankinde was not corrupted. Or if hee made but one man; yet if he made him ſuch as men now are, then could not his actions be accounted any way ſinfull: or if <hi>Adam</hi> by his ſin loſt not his eſtate of happineſſe, or his owne alone, or if there were no hope of reſtoring; then to beleeve any Saviour were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together in vaine; or if there were any other meanes of ſalvation by man or Angell, than that which the Chriſtian faith doth hold; then were all that which followes utterlie needleſſe: therefore it muſt appeare that man was created, firſt one, male and female, and no moe; ſecondly upright and without any taint of originall or actuall ſin; onely ſuch freewill he had, as that he might ſinne if he would, or if hee would not, hee might not haue ſinned.

                        <p n="1">1. The workes of God are ſo made in the perfection of number, and meaſure, as that it is not poſſible to finde any defect or exceſſe therein. But if moe men than one had beene made; if without the power of bringing forth their like, there had beene defect in them, and they needleſſe and in vaine; if with ſuch power of multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as <hi>Adam</hi> had, then had there beene exceſſe in the creature, and God had needleſly brought out mankinde from many roots, which might bee brought out from one alone: but this was unneceſſary in the creature; therefore it could not bee fitting in the wiſdome of the Creator. And therefore he being but one, he created man in his owne image, one man, male, and female. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.27.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The excellencie of Lordſhip or rule muſt be in one alone, &amp; cannot poſſiblie conſiſt in many: ſo that if many men had bin crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Lordſhip of man over the inferiour creature had not beene perfect in one: &amp; although there be now many millions of men, yet the Lordſhip over the creature is to everie one equall with <hi>Adam,</hi>

But the beginning of a ſpecies from one roote is more noble, excellent, and perfect than from many; becauſe in that one both the individuall, and the whole kinde alſo is conteined.

For no cauſe can worke contrary to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and perfections of it ſelfe. But if the cauſe bee powerfull and able to bring forth the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, then muſt the effect alſo bee perfect and upright, and eſpecially free from that which is moſt contrary to the cauſe thereof. But it is before manifeſt that all things had their beginnings from God the moſt powerfull and working of all cauſes: and becauſe of the infinitie of his goodneſſe and iuſtice, hating wickedneſſe and ſinne above all things; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as all his creature was exceeding good, ſo it followes likewiſe that man (as farre as he had any being from God) was alſo good and upright in his being, and ſo without ſinne.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The ability and excellency of the end is more then the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe of all thoſe things which are ordained for the end. But it is manifeſt, that all the viſible creature of this world was created for mans uſe; that he was prince and Lord of all. For by the Law of nature, and iuſtice that ought to bee chiefe which hath moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency above other. Now to ſet aſide the abilities of the minde in the knowledge of things eternall and divine, whereof no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bodily creature hath any feeling or underſtanding: what creature under the whole heaven, in the earth, or Sea, may ſet it ſelfe in compariſon with man for thoſe gifts which the Creator hath vouchſafe to him, in the uſe of all things, in the knowledge of their nature, in memory and remembrance, in the inventions of arts, in the guiding and compelling of the creature to his ſervice, or utter deſtruction of the rebellious. And the refore both in the creation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.28. and againe after the floud, the type of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. were they all delivered into the power of man. Now if all theſe things were for man, and his uſe, and they eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one good in their kinde, much more was man good and upright in his creation.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Every thing is more excellent, as it is for a more excellent and noble end. But the end of man is more excellent than all the creature beſide. For they are for his uſe as their end, but man for the ſervice and glory of God as his end, in the attainement of which alone hee can be happy. And becauſe that which is for any end, muſt have conditions or fitneſſe for that end; it was neceſſary that man
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:107656:69"/>ſhould bee created without ſinne, which above all other things the ſoule of his Creator did hate, and for which alone he was put out of his ſervice.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Every corruption or marring of a thing muſt needs bee of that which was once good; and the greater the perfection thereof was, the worſe is the corruption or wickedneſſe that is therein. But it is too manifeſt that the nature of man is moſt corrupt; therefore it was once very good and upright.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. If God had made man ſuch as man now is, rebellious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefull towards Himſelfe; a plague and calamity to other men through injury, pride, and oppreſſion, a ſlaue to his owne ſenſuall deſires in gluttony and filthie luſt; ignorant of the truth, an enemy to all good, following with greedineſſe all manner of ill; ſubject as to Sinne, ſo to the due puniſhment thereof, all manner of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, ſickneſſe, and death, both of body and ſoule; then had Hee brought the greateſt diſorder into the creature, even there where order was moſT neceſſary, that is, in the prince and Lord thereof, yea ſuch diſorder as ſhould be contrary to it ſelfe, in reſpect of that hatred which men have one toward another: then would he not in juſtice have brought thoſe puniſhments on men which are due for their ſinne in this life, and damnation in that which is to come. But all theſe things are againſt the wiſdome, goodneſſe, and juſtice of God. Therefore man was created in a Contrary eſtate, of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, Iuſtice, and holineſſe.</p>

Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding man is truely ſaid to bee created in the image, or according to the image of <hi>Elohim,</hi> or <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Creator, either naturally, or elſe ſupernaturally: naturally; either according to the ſtate of his body, or of his ſoule, or of the whole compoſition: his body is an abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or compound of all bodily being, becauſe there is nothing in the bodily creature, which is not in ſome ſort in that little world of mans body, as reaſon proves by his food, and medicine, out of all bodies here below; and as the Phyſitians, and all naturalliſts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, and as <hi>Paracelſus</hi> more particularly every where ſhewes and proves. So that as all things even bodily beings, were created in Chriſt, and therefore were in Him eminently, by their formes, and potentially, as being by Him brought into act, or effect: So are they all in the body of man repreſentatively: and though by his ſinne ſubject to the curſe, as he their Presbyter is; yet ſhall they bee deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from this bondage of corruption, when the glorious liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Sonnes of God, ſhall appeare, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.19.20. to 24. And concerning the ſoule, if you looke into the faculties thereof, beyond them that concerne the body alone in growth, and ſenſe; if in the underſtanding you conſider the powers of the imagination or thought, of the diſcourſe, of memory, of the will and the freedome thereof, in civill and morall things; you may truly ſay, that all things are ſubject to their Lord and Creator; ſo hath Hee made all things ſubiect to the poſſibilities of mans underſtanding, in as much as the Spirit of man conſiders all things; yea preſumes to ſearch even the deepe things of God. Now one ſoule with all theſe properties argues the wonderfull excellency thereof; and what a lively ſtampe of his wiſdome He hath imprinted therein. But becauſe the whole of every thing is more excellent then the parts which are for the perfection of the whole, and that the ſoule out of the body hath no power of growth, of ſence, of imagination (and becauſe it would not be deſtitute of the native abilities and powers of it ſelfe, it parts ſo unwillingly from the body, &amp; cannot poſſibly forſake it for ever, as it will appeare hereafter) therefore the excellency of that image appeares not onely in the parts, as I have ſhewed, but much more in the compound of the body and ſoule together, wherein are all things both bodily and ſpirituall ſo repreſented, as that the ſhape of a man cannot bee more lively ſeene in a looking glaſſe, than the whole creature is repreſented in man, the epitome or ſumme of all.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, what is there in all nature which hee makes not art to imitate? yea and beyond any patterne in nature, adventures in a frame of wood? to compaſſe both land and Sea, what arts doth not he finde out, and becauſe hee knowes hee cannot come to nought, what dares he not to undertake in peace or warre? And if every ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect doe repreſent the cauſe, with the power, &amp; vertues thereof, as it
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:107656:70"/>is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. <hi>&amp; Rom.</hi> 1.29. then much more that which is the ſumme and principle effect of all. And this is that threefold image in which <hi>Adam</hi> was created, and which remaines unblotted out, yet wonderfully ſtayned in every man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.7. But becauſe it is ſpoken of the whole man, that hee was created in the image of God; you are to underſtand that Image firſt in the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall compoſition of his body and ſoule, as I have ſhewed: Secondly, in regard of his Lordſhip over all this viſible creature: and thirdly, and moſt of all in thoſe ſupernaturall endowments of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and holineſſe wherein he was created. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.24. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 2.23. With the ability to continue in that ſtate, if hee had not ſinned, and a freedome alſo of will to ſin, or not to ſinne. And thus was <hi>Adam</hi> the Image of <hi>Elohim</hi> ſupernaturally, and for the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Image being now loſt, are all thoſe benefits which God in Chriſt hath vouchſafed to his Church.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Object.</hi> 1. But if man were created in the image of God, what preheminence is that which is given unto Chriſt. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15. That he is the Image of the inviſible God? An Image is twofold, <hi>homagene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> which is in the perfection of the ſame being, as <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 5.3. begat a Sonne in his owne likeneſſe, after his owne Image; and ſo Chriſt the Sonne of God is the image of the Father, as was ſhewed, <hi>chap.</hi> 11. or <hi>heterogeneous,</hi> that is, of a different being, which is either in the underſtanding only, as the <hi>Ideas</hi> or formes of things conceived in the minde: or elſe materiall, wherein is the repreſentation of ſome property belonging to another, as the image of <hi>Alexander</hi> may expreſſe that ſhape which was proper to his perſon. And thus man was created in the image of God, as I ſhewed. And if this repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation be more darke and further off in ſome one particular thing, it is rather called a ſigne, a proofe, a footſtep, or marke than an Image. As the pricking of an hare in the ſnow, is a marke or ſigne that ſhe hath beene there. And thus every thing created is a ſigne or marke of the power of the Creator, as the matier, forme or proprietie in one being, is a ſtep, ſigne or argument of the Trinity in the Vnity, that is, a proofe thereof, as every effect is a proofe or witneſſe of the cauſe.</p>

For as hee had power both in body and ſoule to performe all the dutie of man if hee would; ſo had hee received power to will or not to wil all that hee could; that his ſinne and puniſhment might bee of himſelfe. But that man might know that neither his power, nor yet his will, could bee well directed without the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of his Creator, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.5. therefore being left unto Himſelfe he quickly found what he was able to doe of himſelfe, that he ſhould never after that ſeeke himſelfe in himſelfe, but in Him alone, who of his good pleaſure workes in man both to will and to doe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. Thus man being left to himſelfe ſinned willingly: the woman being deceived by the craft of the devill, the enemy of mankinde, but the man with leſſe ſinne, if ignorantly. But igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is of three ſorts, ſimple, willing, and wilfull. Simple ignorance may be in the ſtate of innocency, and is without ſinne; as in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of heaven, <hi>Math.</hi> 24.36. as in children, <hi>Luc.</hi> 2.52. And in them to whom it is not given to know what they would, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.7. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ignorance is in them that care not to know what they ought to know: this is a ſinne with careleſneſſe, and excuſes not from the fewer ſtripes, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.48. But wilfull ignorance is in them that ſtubbornely refuſe to know what they both may, and ought to know. This is a ſinne with ſcorne, and excuſes not from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtripes, becauſe it is with wilfull diſobedience, as of them that know and doe not. If <hi>Adams</hi> eating had beene with ignorance of the firſt kinde, hee had not ſinned in eating. But this ignorance (as concerning that wherin he ſinned) was not in <hi>Adam.</hi> But if he did eat ignorantly in the ſecond kinde, his ſin was in this, that he did eat unadviſedly that which he ought to have knowne, and for which he ought to have given thanks to his Creator. The third kinde of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance could not be in him: For then he had ſinned before he did eate. But if no degree of ignorance were in him, but that he did eat knowing; yet preſuming on his mercy whom hee did offend, though his ſinne were greater, yet was it pardonable; becauſe hee truſted in his mercy againſt whom hee ſinned. But this ſinne was not in him. But the woman being deceived through her
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:107656:71"/>errour was the cauſe of his tranſgreſſion, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.14. And if he had eaten preſumptuouſly, then had his ſinne beene greater than that of <hi>Eve;</hi> whereas his leſſer puniſhment argues his leſſe offence. So then it ſeemes that the man alone having received the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, did faithfully deliver it to the woman after her creation. So that her firſt ſinne (though it were not imputed, becauſe there was yet no law whereby ſhee was ſubjected to her husband) was, that ſhee gave not firme credit to the word of her husband delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the commandement of God; but that ſhee ſuffered her ſelfe to bee withdrawne by the craft of the devill, ſpeaking in the ſerpent: but that his ſinne was in this, that hee did unaduiſedly eat that which the woman gave him, not minding what it was, as he pleads for himſelfe before Him with whom he could not lye, <hi>The woman gave me of the tree, and I did eate.</hi> And thus was there mercy reſerved for man, both in regard of that weake eſtate wherein hee was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in compariſon of the Angels; and in reſpect of the quality, and meaſure of his ſinne, and of the meanes whereby he was drawne thereto: whereas the Angels that kept not their firſt eſtate, but wilfully ſinned againſt God, for their three ſinnes, and for foure could never finde any place of repentance. But it is ſaid, <hi>Iob.</hi> 31.33. <hi>If I have covered my ſinne as Adam:</hi> By which it ſeemes his ſinne was more than he confeſſed. I anſwer. The word <hi>(Adam)</hi> there uſed, and ſo the word <hi>Enoch</hi> in divers places of Scripture doe ſignifie man in his ſinnefull and wretched eſtate indefinitely, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 144.3. <hi>Iehovah,</hi> what is <hi>Adam</hi> that thou knoweſt him? the Sonne of <hi>Enoch,</hi> that thou makeſt any account of him? And therefore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers good tranſlations reade that text of <hi>Iob, If I have covered my ſinne as Man,</hi> who doth commonly excuſe his ſinne, and leſſen his offence. But of what ſort ſoever the ſin of man was, it is moſt certaine that he did ſinne.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. For as the effect is manifeſt by the cauſe; ſo the cauſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by the effect. Now death is the wages of ſinne. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. ſo then ſinne is the cauſe of that puniſhment. And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very puniſhment is for ſome offence. But it is ruanifeſt that <hi>Adam</hi> was puniſhed, even unto death it ſelfe. For otherwiſe hee had lived untill now and hereafter. Therefore it is manifeſt <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It is proved before that all the creature was good and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in every kinde, and that man was the prime and chiefe of all the viſible creature, and therefore that hee was created for the moſt excellent end, which is to bee happy in Him, who is the chiefeſt good; of which happineſſe hee could not have fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, if he had continued in the ſtate of his creation. For every thing ordained for an end, by a cauſe that is powerfull thereto; muſt bee furniſhed with meanes ſufficient for the attainement of that end. But it is manifeſt, that <hi>Adam</hi> hath failed of that happineſſe by the utter loſſe of life, and preſent being. Therefore hee continued
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:107656:71"/>hee continued not in the ſtate of his creation, but ſinned againſt his Creator.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Death is the puniſhment of ſome great offence in the reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable creature, who is able to make a difference betweene good ill. But it is manifeſt that <hi>Adam</hi> was not created ſinfull, and therefore not ſubject to death. And againe, it is manifeſt that that ſtate of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> was changed, becauſe he is dead. But that change was not made by God, becauſe it was contrary to his ordinance; neither could it bee made by enforcement of any outward meanes; For then <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> had not beene made ſinfull thereby. Therefore it was made by the willing act of <hi>Adam</hi> himſelfe, and hee thereby ſubjected to Sinne.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Nothing can be ſo inſeparably in the whole off-ſpring which is not firſt in the originall; as the fruit cannot be wholly poyſonous if the root or ſtem bee not firſt infected. But it is learned by lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table experience, that the whole maſſe of mankinde is wholly ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and corrupted; and that no man can ſay his heart is cleane, therefore it muſt needs bee that the root or originall from whence they are deſcended (which wee have already proved to have beene one) was ſinnefull and corrupt.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Man with much care and government in his youth, with much heed and warineſſe in his owne carriage, is hardly at laſt brought unto a courſe of a vertuous life; and that not without many wicked deſires and ſinfull deedes. But if the firſt man had not corrupted his nature, all vertue, and that alone had been naturall to all men. But experience ſhewes the contrary: Therefore <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by corrupted his whole nature.</p>
                        <p>But you will ſay, If that ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> were onely a ſinne of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and that in ſo ſmall a thing as the eating of an apple; the puniſhment of death, and that both of body and ſoule, can no way ſeeme to be proportionable. For ſhall not the judge of all the world doe right? And if the leaſt ſinne deſerve the greateſt puniſhment, what puniſhment can be left for the greateſt ſinne? or ſhall wee ſay (as the Stoicks taught) that all ſinnes are equall? I anſwer. That ſinnes compared one with another, are truly ſaid to be leſſer or grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one than another. For it is a leſſe ſinne to thinke ill of a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſervedly, than to hate him; And that, than to maime him; and that, than to murder him; and that, than to defame him. For moſt of theſe degrees hold in them, all thoſe ſinnes that are under it. So that as the Stoickes truely ſaid, every later exceeds by the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſinnes that are therein. Yet is there no ſinne in it ſelfe, how little ſoever it ſeeme, but in the rigor of Gods Iuſtice deſerves more puniſhment than al that which the ſinner can beare, becauſe of his greatneſſe who is diſhonoured thereby. For the greater any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, the greater is the offence whereby he is diſhonoured. As for a word of ſcorne ſpoken by a meane man againſt his equall, a ſmall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment may make amends; for which offence againſt a Peere
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:107656:72"/>a <hi>Scandalum Magnatum</hi> may be brought; and if it had beene ſpoken to the diſhonour of the king, it might iuſtly bee accounted high treaſon in the ſpeaker. How great then may wee hold that offence to be, which is againſt the Majeſty of God? before whom all the nations of the earth, are not ſo much as the drop from a buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket falling into a mighty river, <hi>Es. c.</hi> 40.15.2. Moreover every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of his being a rule of infinite Iuſtice; an infinite Iuſtice is offended by the breach therof. And what ſatisfaction can a finite creature make to an infinite Iuſtice that is offended? but becauſe it cannot beare a puniſhment <hi>intenſivè</hi> infinite, or infinite in quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, therefore it is iuſt that it ſhould beare it <hi>extenſivè</hi> in the infinity of Continuance. Now as it was neceſſary that God ſhould give a law unto man, that he might evermore acknowledge that duty and obedience which he ought to his Creator: ſo having enabled him both in body and ſoule to performe his law, which was alſo ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie a burthen, as that it ſtood not in doing any thing; but onely in the forbearance of one fruit among a million: it was moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that God in His iuſtice ſhould require that breach of His law. Which law, the more eaſie it was to bee kept; ſo much the ſorer puniſhment did <hi>Adam</hi> deſerve for the breach thereof. And thus did that murtherer of mankinde by the ſinne of our firſt Parents ſet open a doore for the Iuſtice of God to breake out upon them, being now liable to eternall puniſhment: yet did they not hereby bring on their owne puniſhment alone, inaſmuch as all their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are made lyable with them to the ſame condemnation.</p>
                        <p>§.2. It may ſeeme a needleſſe queſtion to aske, how long <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood in his innocency? but becauſe opinions have beene about the time of his fall, wherein they have differed from the firſt day of his Creation, to three yeers and an halfe; betweene which others have thought a weeke, ſome tenne dayes, or ſeventeene at moſt, others halfe a yeare, <hi>Lidg: de Emend. temp.</hi> Omitting conjectures, it will not be unfit to examine it by reaſon, and Scripture, which hath not left us without a guide and inſtruction in any doubt that may be moved therein. The <hi>Hebrewes</hi> compare <hi>Adam</hi> to an oxe that had horns, and no hoofs; by which they meant he had no ſtrength at all to walk in the commandements of God; but aſſoone as he was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he puſhed rebelliouſly againſt his ordinance. The ordinances of God (over and aboue the preheminences which He gave him in hiscreation) were three. Marriage, for the due propagation of mans naturall life, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.24. the law of the tree of knowledge; the figure of the life of grace, <hi>ch.</hi> 2.17. and the Sabbath, the aſſurance of the life of glory. For it were a witleſſe thing to think that God ſanctified that day for his owne uſe, but for man to meditate in the workes of God, and for remembrance of his hopes to come. <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was againſt the ſecond: but it will appeare by the circumſtances of the other two, when that tranſgreſſion was committed. <hi>Adam</hi> was created a perfect man, in the prime and chiefe of his ſtrength; and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:107656:72"/>accordingly received that bleſſing to bring forth fruit and multiply. Now, if <hi>Adam</hi> according to that bleſſing had in his innocency en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured the propagation of mankind; it cannot be ſuppoſed, that God, who had immediately before given him that bleſſing to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply, would immediately have taken it away againe. And that act of <hi>Adam</hi> not being in vaine, that firſt ſonne of <hi>Adam</hi> muſt have bin holy, and without the taint of originall ſinne, although the parents had ſinned afterward before it was borne. For that ſtaine of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinne comes from the conception, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.5. not by the birth. But no ſuch holy ſeed of <hi>Adam</hi> is mentioned; nor none ſuch could bee; For the Lord looked downe from heaven upon the ſonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> and they were altogether become filthy. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.3. Now, if <hi>Adam</hi> were created ſuch as hee was, aske any luſty young man how many nights hee would allow to his beloved and moſt beautifull Bride in her virginity, and give ſo many to <hi>Adam</hi> before hee ſinned.</p>
                        <p>So then it may ſeeme that wee may take that Storie of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture concerning <hi>Adam,</hi> thus. <hi>Adam</hi> being made in the morning, that God might give him experience of the excellencie of that eſtate wherein he was created, brought the Beaſtes and Birds before him, and gave him the Lordſhip over them all: which that hee might exerciſe as he ought, hee gave him perfect underſtanding of their nature, and power of words whereby to expreſſe their nature, and to command them. For as <hi>Adam</hi> named every thing, ſo was the name thereof. But that man might know that hee was for a more noble end than to live among beaſts; Hee tooke him and put him in the Garden of delight, furniſhed with fruits for every ſeaſon, and gave him power to eate of all, excepting the forbidden tree. At noone that heavie ſleepe fell on him, in which the woman was made out of his ſide. Hee awaking, the marriage was ſolemnized, and the woman by her husband diligently warned to forbeare to eate, or to touch the forbidden fruit. But while ſhe wandred from her Husband, to chuſe fruit to her liking (for it is manifeſt that her Husband was not with her when ſhee was deceived 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.14.) ſhee was encountred by the devill poſſeſſing the Serpent, and drawn into ſinne, and this about the ninth hower, or three of the clocke in the afternoone; as all the ſacrifices of the Law, and that ſacrifice for ſinne whereby the workes of the devill were deſtroyed, doe ſufficiently witnes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.46. <hi>&amp;</hi> 50. Thus man being in honor, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> 
                           <hi>bal yalin,</hi> could not continue a night, but by his ſinne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſubiect to death, as the beaſts that periſh. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.12.</p>
                        <p>The hereſie of <hi>Pelagius</hi> was like a Serpent with many heads, of which this was one; that <hi>Adam</hi> was created mortall, and though hee had not ſinned, yet ſhould he have died; not for the merit or puniſhment of his ſinne, but for the condition or ſtate of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for being made of the elements, which in everie elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall body may be ſeparated, and in their ſimple being are changed one into another; it cannot be thought (ſaid hee) that <hi>Adams</hi> ſtate
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:107656:73"/>could be more continuall than that from whence hee had his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. Beſides having in his innocencie need of meate to reſtore the decay of his body, his body cannot be ſuppoſed immortall; but the anſwer is eaſie. For that immortality depended on the ſoule which ſhould not have parted from the body, but ſhould have ever been able to uphold the body without corruption, ſicknes, or death. And although any particular change had beene in the body, yet ſhould it not have beene in the whole, no more than that corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or change which is in the ſimple elements: therefore <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocencie was immortall abſolutely, inaſmuch as his immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſoule ſhould never have forſaken his body; but he was mortall onely on condition, if he did ſinne. So mortalitie was the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his ſinne: but that which is put upon a man as a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, can no way belong unto him in the ſtate of his innocencie. But it is plaine that death was inflicted on him for his ſinne: for why ſhould it be ſaid to him, <hi>In the day that thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt dye the death.

                           <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nother error of <hi>Pelagius</hi> was, that <hi>Adam</hi> by his ſin did hurt himſelfe alone; but that his poſteritie were no way tainted thereby with any originall ſinne, nor brought in danger of eternall death: which as it is contrary to the autority of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture; ſo do they thereby put an abſolute neceſſitie on the juſtice of God, to admit thoſe infants, that never commited any actuall ſin, into eternall happines: whereby, as the mercie of God; ſo alſo the death of Chriſt, as far as he ſhould be a Saviour to them, is utterly in vaine: for what need they mercie or Mediatour, who for their owne worthineſſe muſt enter into everlaſting life? yet this poyſon the <hi>Socinians</hi> of late have lick't up as a reſtorative; which hereſie with other of theirs you may reade in <hi>Wentſel a Budowecs pag.</hi> 232. <hi>&amp;</hi> 233. But as <hi>Adam</hi> had received originall righteouſneſſe, ſo by his ſinne did he loſe what he had received, and that not for himſelfe alone; but alſo for his poſteritie: for hee being that common perſon in whom the whole race of mankinde was, whatſoever gifts or graces God
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:107656:73"/>gave unto him, hee gave them as a king, to him and his for ever, if hee as a faithfull liege-man ſhould performe thoſe ſervices that were belonging to that ſtate wherein he was infeoffed: but if hee performed not that ſervice whereto hee was bound, then muſt he alſo forfeit that eſtate for him and his for ever. And becauſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries are knowne each by other, as a crooked line by a ſtraight; it may eaſilie appeare what that originall ſinne is, whereto all the ſonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> were made lyable by his offence: for if <hi>Adam</hi> were created in originall righteouſneſſe; ſo that hee had power both to know, and to doe that which was pleaſing to God, and a freedome of his will to continue or not to continue in that ſtate (and without any of thoſe conditions he could not be perfect) then muſt it needs follow that by that ſin of his, both he, and his poſterity are deprived both of that knowledge of the will of God, of the knowedge of the creature alſo, and of all abilitie to doe or will any thing (as of our ſelves) that may be pleaſing in his ſight: for as that originall righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe had with it not onely an innocencie, harmeleſneſſe, or freedome from ſinne, but likewiſe a poſitive ſtrength to doe that which was good; ſo likewiſe that originall ſinne brought with it a corruption of the underſtanding, a frowardneſſe of the will, a heavineſſe or unableneſſe to all good; and more than that, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence or ill deſire leading the minde captive unto ſinne: for contrarie cauſes muſt have contrarie effects; ſo, as God had crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that firſt righteouſneſſe in the heart of man: ſo when man did willingly forſake his ſervice, and of himſelfe betooke himſelfe to the ſervice of his enemie the devill (for to whomſoever a man doth yeeld himſelfe to obey, his ſervant he is to whom hee doth obey) the devill not onely willingly entertained this new come gueſt, whoſe ſervice he ſo much longed for; but alſo gave him his livery, and infected his heart with contrarie conditions, that he might never after be fit for the entertainment of his former Lord. For of contraries about the ſame ſubject, one muſt of neceſſitie be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as light or darkeneſſe in the ayer; health or ſickneſſe in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, ſight or blindneſſe in the eye: ſo that in ſtead of the former vertues, wherby the Spirit of grace did guide mans heart to God, he is now not only utterly diſabled to doe that whereto his conſcience tels him he is bound, but alſo become a thrall of Satan, to be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and governed according to his will. And this wretched and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full eſtate, with the guiltineſſe or obligation unto the puniſhment thereof, which is the death both of bodie and ſoule, is that origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinne wherein every one of <hi>Adams</hi> children is conceived and borne; and for which he is ſubject unto death: for ſo was the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that in what day hee ſinned he ſhould die the death. And though <hi>Adam</hi> inſtantly did not finde himſelfe to die; yet by the juſt ſentence of the Law and juſtice of God did he finde himſelfe ſpiritually dead, that is, deſtitute of the grace of God, and that ſtrength which he had to doe his will, and therefore ſubject to this
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:107656:74"/>neceſſitie, that he muſt die at laſt, and ſo in an eſtate contrarie to that in which he was created: neither ought it to ſeeme ſtrange, or unjuſt, that God ſhould puniſh this ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> in his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie alſo: for as it was perſonall in reſpect of himſelfe, to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe liable to the wrath of God; ſo his naturall gifts being loſt and corrupted, the contrarie qualities brought in in ſtead thereof, became a naturall contagion to all his poſteritie. There is heere ſome little queſtion, whether this ignorance, frowardneſſe, heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and concupiſcence before ſpoken of be the effects of originall ſinne, the wounds of nature (as the ſchooles call them) or the ſinne it ſelfe. But as their contraries were in originall juſtice, as the parts, or as the poperties, or as the effects thereof; ſo muſt theſe be in originall ſinne, to mee they ſee me to bee that ſpirituall death that was threatned to <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo the preſent puniſhment of that ſinne; and in them that are not renewed to the life of grace, the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of that further puniſhment that ſhall come upon the ſoule hereafter. Let us not ſtay in needleſſe queſtions, but looke to the proofes of our concluſion: for by the knowledge of originall righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe it will appeare what theſe things are.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Becauſe nothing can bring forth naturally any other thing than ſuch as it ſelfe is. If <hi>Adam</hi> were in himſelfe corrupted, as hath beene ſhewed, <hi>Chap.</hi> 16. hee could not beget any other child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren but ſuch as were corrupted. And foraſmuch as all men in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice are accounted as one man, in reſpect of the common nature whereof they are all partakers; it is juſt with God to puniſh all men alike for their common corruption, from which no man can ſay his heart is cleane: for doth any man forbeareto kill an adder though he never yet ſtung any man or beaſt? I thinke not; but becauſe the whole nature of adders is venimous, therefore will he kill him.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It cannot ſtand with the juſtice of God to puniſh any one with death who is not lyable to that puniſhment for ſome of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Now the ſinne of thoſe infants who from their birth are carried to their grave, not being any actuall ſinne to which any election or conſent of the minde could come; it is plaine that they are puniſhed for their originall ſin. And concerning them that have lived to take an account of their owne wayes, there needs no other proofe than the teſtimony of every mans conſcience whether they finde not the law of ſinne in themſelves warring againſt themſelves and leading them captive unto ſinne, contrarie to the law of their own minds. This is that burthen under which the Saints doe groan ſo, as that they hate themſelves therfore, and deſire to be delivered from this bodie of death <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And why of death? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the wages of ſinne wrought in the body is death <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. yet not of the body onely, but of the ſoule alſo; both in regard of this inbred contagion, that bitter root, and of that conſent which it gives to ſinne; that I ſay nothing of them who through cuſtome follow ſinne with greedineſſe.</p>
                        <pb n="117" facs="tcp:107656:74"/>
                        <p n="3">3. Every creature naturally continues in that eſtate and followes thoſe things whereto it was created, except ſome great contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie befall to the hinderance thereof. But man was created to know and to love God, and to ſee his wiſdome in the creature, and to honour him therfore, and doing thus to be happie for ever thereby: yet nothing of this is done accordingly by any among all the ſons of <hi>Adam:</hi> therefore ſome great hindrance and contrarietie is come between. But nothing that good is could be an hindrance to this great good; nor yet any thing which is without the man himſelfe. Therefore mans ſinne alone which hath infected all, hath beene the onely hinderance of all this good.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The holy Scripture ſhewes the truth of this in <hi>Iob</hi> 14.4. <hi>Who can bring a cleane thing out of uncleanneſſe? not one.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.5. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I was ſhapen in iniquitie, and in ſinne hath my mother conceived mee.

                           <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Vt if the whole world be thus become guiltie before God, is it for this end, that the whole world may bee ſubjected to eternall death? God forbid; but as ſin hath abounded unto condemnation, ſo hath the grace and righteouſneſſe of God abounded much more unto everlaſting life: for as by the offence of one, judgement came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all men to condemnation; ſo by the righteouſneſſe of one, the free pardon came unto all men for juſtification unto life. <hi>See Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>Chap.</hi> Therefore leſt man at the ſight of his owne perfections ſhould ſinne through pride unrecoverably as the devils, it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould ſinne as hee did, that a way might bee made for the juſtice and mercie of God to bee manifeſt, and that man at the ſight of his ſinne might be humbled before his Creator, and ſo received to grace. The whole world then being liable to the juſtice of God by that ſinne of our firſt father, as hath beene ſhewed; now it remaines in this place to prove, that there is a
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:107656:75"/>poſſibilitie to returne to God, in whoſe favour and acceptance onely is life and happineſſe. And for the more cleere proofe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; let us firſt lay this ſure foundation: that all the workes of God, and all the poſſibilities in the creature are knowne to him from all eternitie. Secondly, that to doe well, and right, and to withſtand ſinne, and the temptations of the devill requires a poſitive ſtrength, and grace in the heart of man, which grace man cannot take unto himſelfe, becauſe no creature can be partaker either of being, or of ſtrength, or any good, but onely ſo far forth as it is imparted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; and where the want of ſtrength is, the effect of that want on all occaſions muſt needs appeare. So that ſince <hi>Adams</hi> fall man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not onely deprived of that ſtrength to reſiſt ſinne which <hi>Adam</hi> had, but alſo infected with a naturall corruption and inclination to ſin, which they call concupiſcence: man hath no helpe in himſelfe to helpe himſelfe, upon which grounds the reaſon will follow thus. If there be not a poſſibility of the reſtoring of man into the favour and grace of God, from which hee fell by his ſin, then could not the juſtice of God be without great iniquity and injuſtice. (Let him be mercifull, that we ſpeake according to the manner of men; that is, according to that reaſon and underſtanding which he hath given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men for the manifeſtation of his glorie and grace) For if God in the infinity of his wiſdome, foreſeeing that man being created would ſin, and yet would create him, and for his ſin utterly caſt off the whole race of mankinde to deſtruction, neither could any place of mercie bee found with him, for which the creature could give him glorie, neither could that juſtice be but with great injuſtice, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as they that never were ſhould without any deſert be crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to eternall puniſhment, and they that had done the leaſt ſinnes; nay they that had done neither good nor ill, as they that die in their infancie ſhould bee ſhut out to eternall death, aſwell as they that all their life time had followed all manner of ſinne with greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. So alſo all the commandements of God tending to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of life, and all his threatnings and promiſes ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaine. So alſo all the endeavours of holy and devout men, who through his grace ſtrive to the maſterdome of their owne wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and all the conſtancie of them who have ſuffered for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of his truth and ſervice, ſhould be unrewarded. So vertue ſhould have no advantage over vice in the difference of the reward. But all theſe things are impoſſible: therefore there is a reſtoring of man to that favour and grace of God, from which he was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate by his ſinne.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If there were not a reſtoring of mankinde to that eſtate from which he is fal'n, then the ſin of man a finite creature ſhould be more powerfull to the deſtruction of the worke of God, who made man to everlaſting life, than the power &amp; wiſdome of God ſhould to the upholding of the creature in that eſtate wherein he created it. So ill, and ſin, things not being ſhold have preheminence for miſchiefe,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:107656:75"/>above an infinite power and goodneſſe for glorie and happineſſe. But this is impoſſible: therefore as by ſinne there was a generall wrack of mankinde; ſo it is neceſſarie that there be a generall reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, powerfull and ſufficient for the ſinnes of the whole world, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vayleable and effectuall to all that beleeve it, and ſhew the fruit of their faith by their ſtrife againſt ſinne, and doing ſuch good workes as God hath created that we ſhould walke in them.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Faith, hope, charity, temperance, and all other Chriſtian and morall vertues are the worke of Gods Spirit in man, who of himſelfe is not able no not to thinke a good thought. But it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that the Spirit of God ſhould worke in vaine, or to no end in the heart of man, to beleeve the forgiveneſſe of his ſinnes and to hope for everlaſting life, &amp;c. or that God ſhould not accept his owne worke in his creature, which is ever for the good of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Therefore there is a reſtoring of man to thoſe hopes of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe which he had loſt.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The continuance of the world, and the creatures therein by a being of infinite power, wiſdome and goodneſſe, muſt bee to an end exceedingly good: therefore there is a reſtoring of man, that the effect of that goodneſſe may appeare in his everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting life and happineſſe: for if the continuance of the world bee for the multiplication of mankinde, onely for ſatisfaction of the divine juſtice upon mankinde for his ſinne; then ſhould it bee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie that the world were everlaſting, that the everlaſting juſtice might receive everlaſting ſatisfaction; but ſo the greater power of the Creator in the longer continuance of the world ſhould bee for the greater affliction and hurt of the creature; ſo the infinitie of his power ſhould bee infinitely diſtant from his mercie and pitie, the effect of his goodneſſe toward his creature; ſo he ſhould have made the creature and the continuance thereof becauſe he hated it, not becauſe hee loved it. But all theſe things are impoſſible, and againſt the dignities which wee have before proved to bee in God one infinite being, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>§.1. From hence alſo it will appeare that the reſtoring is to an eſtate of further happineſſe, than the continuance of that naturall life in which, and unto which <hi>Adam</hi> was at firſt created. For if the advantage in the recoverie were not greater than the loſſe was by the ſinne, then had the ſinne beene permitted to no end; then had the loſſe been ſuſtained in vaine, and all thoſe afflictions which mankinde hath ever ſince endured ſhould be without recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence in the reward. But it is impoſſible that God ſhould permit ſinne in man, and the puniſhment thereof afflictions and death, onely to ſet man in the ſame ſtate wherein he was before; for that had been to no end at all, it had beene in vaine to ſuffer his owne juſtice to bee violated, in vaine to give his Sonne to die, onely to reſtore man to that ſtate which hee had loſt, wherein hee might have been kept, and all theſe inconveniences ſaved. Therefore
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:107656:76"/>the recovery is with a ſuperexcellencie of glorie and happineſſe far above that which <hi>Adam</hi> loſt.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It is the glorie of the wiſdome of God, out of the greateſt ill to bring the greateſt good. The greateſt ill which the devill by ſinne could bring upon man, was the loſſe of his worldly life and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and to make him liable to the wrath of God, and ſo to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death: therefore the infinite mercy and wiſdome prepared ſo powerfull a remedie againſt this poyſon of the old Serpent, that the life and happineſſe in this world was changed to that which is to be in eternitie in the heavens with an exceeding weight of glory which no words can utter, neither can it come into the heart of man to conceive. And this with that aſſurance of the favour and love of God in Chriſt, from which neither height, nor depth, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come ſhall ever bee able to ſeparate us. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.38.39.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. Every offender againſt an infinite juſtice, muſt in juſtice

                        <p n="3">3. No creation can bee without an infinite power (as it hath beene prooved) therefore much leſſe can the reſtoring of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being fallen from the eſtate of Grace. For in the Creation there was nothing which hindered the worke of the Creator; But in the eſtate of ſinne there is an impediment, firſt in the corruption which is in the underſtanding, and frowardneſſe of the will turned away from God; Secondly in the concupiſcence, whereby man is in thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the ſervice of ſinne, &amp;c.

                        <p n="4">4 No man can pay for another that for which he is indebted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe But every man, and every other Creature doth owe unto God whatſoever it is, or whatſoever it can doe.

Therefore man might eaſily corrupt himſelfe; but being corrupted hee cannot poſſibly repaire himſelfe, nor yet doe any thing that is good or acceptable, <hi>Math.</hi> 7.18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12.33.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. But the ſatisfaction being now made, are wee not reſtored un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to as good an eſtate by the ſuffering of Chriſt, as that which <hi>Adam</hi> loſt? ſo that if <hi>Adam</hi> for his obedience ſake might have lived a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall life eternally; wee alſo for our workes ſake may bee accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted worthy of everlaſting bliſſe. For if wee be reſtored by Chriſt, and for his ſake accepted, our workes likewiſe are for his ſake both accepted and rewarded according to their merit. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I ſay, that our eſtate is farre better than <hi>Adams</hi> in this, that his hope of everlaſting life, being ſet in his owne obedience, did inſtantly faile; but ours, ſtanding in the obedience of Chriſt, who is made to us righteouſneſſe, ſanctification, redemption and life, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver faile. For therefore becauſe that pretious treaſure of eternall life was ſo careleſly kept by <hi>Adam,</hi> God who loved the ſalvation of mankinde better then man himſelfe, would in no wiſe commit the keeping of that jewell to man any more. Therefore though ſinne have no power to condemne them that are in Chriſt, yet is it ſtill ſuffered to dwell in us, that wee ſhould not truſt in our ſelves, but in the living God. For as the Father ſaith, <hi>Multum no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis in hac carne tribueremus, niſi uſque ad ejus depoſitionem ſub ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niâ viveremus. Aug. de Civ. lib.</hi> 10. <hi>cap.</hi> 22. And although <hi>Adam</hi> by the grace and favour of his Creator, might have continued in the eſtate in which hee was created, if hee had ſtood in his innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: yet could hee not even then have beene ſaid to merit ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life. For merit, or hire, comes ever for that which is above duty, which cannot bee in the creature towards the Creator. As to a hired ſervant the wages, merit, or hire, comes for his worke; becauſe it was in his power whether hee would labour for that maſter or no, being not bound unto him but for his hire: but in a bondman the poſſeſſion of his Lord, all his ſervice and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is his Lords to require, and imploy it as it pleaſeth him, <hi>Luke.</hi> 17.8.9. and this is the condition of the whole creature to
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:107656:77"/>the Lord and Creator of all. And if <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocency could not merit, much leſſe can ſinnefull man merit any thing but affliction and death by his ſinne and ſervice to the devill, to whom hee is no way bound but by his ſinne. And this difference the Apoſtle maketh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. the wages of ſinne is death, but the free gift of God is eternall life.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. But are wee not commanded to worke out our ſaluation with feare and trembling? <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12. and is not the ſentence of everlaſting life pronounced for the workes of charity which were foreſeene in us, and for which the kingdome of heaven was prepared for us from the beginning of the world? <hi>Math.</hi> 25. <hi>verſ.</hi> 34.35.36. Anſwer. What merit can any man claime for that which another hath principally wrought in him? And if God worketh in us to will, and to doe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. what is our worke, but that wee ſhould with joy runne after Him that drawes vs? <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.4. Therefore although good workes are ordained of God that wee ſhould walke in them, and that wee are created thereunto, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10. and that God who choſe us in Chriſt to bee heires of glory; ordained all the meanes thereto, and workes in us to bee ready to every good worke: and thereby makes our calling and election ſure unto us: yet is not that worke ſolely and intirely ours, but chiefely of the grace and ſpirit of Chriſt that dwels in us, and crownes His owne good workes in us with everlaſting life. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. So then our workes muſt vaniſh, that every mouth may bee ſtopped, and the whole world may bee guilty before God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19. So that every man notwithſtanding his owne workes, even the chiefeſt among the Saints, may with <hi>Iob</hi> abhorre himſelfe, and repent in ſackcloth and and aſhes, <hi>Iob.</hi> 42.6.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. The naturall deſires common to all men cannot bee in vaine, becauſe they come not unto them out of any particular choyſe or preſent neceſſity, but by influence or direction of that common nature which is in all men, which though it cannot effect it, yet hath it ſhewed what is to bee wrought for the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt good of every particular, by the Lord of Nature. But every man by the inclination of his owne will, doth deſire the uttermoſt perfection and happpineſſe of his owne being, which hee acknowledges to bee in being united to that which is the greateſt good, and the enjoying thereof in eternall life. Therefore every man by the guidance of nature it ſelfe, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne unto God as the Author and Finiſher of his happineſſe. Anſwer. No agent can worke of it ſelfe above the proper ſtrength and power of it ſelfe. And eternall life is a thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the limits of naturall knowledge and deſire, which mindes onely the well-being and continuance of the whole man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the preſent eſtate of this naturall life alone. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:107656:78"/>Hee that wils not the death of a ſinner, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 33.11. would have all men to come to the knowledge of the truth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. therefore are all men ſo farre inſtructed (or at leaſt if they doe not willfully winke may bee ſo farre inſtructed) either by the voyce of the creature, or by certaine inbred notions, or by tradition, or by an influence of grace denyed to none: that they may know the eternall power and Godhead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. and the immortality of the ſoule, in a better eſtate then this life can afford, as hath beene ſaid before, in Pref. And this is that univerſall grace which wee may yeeld to bee vouchſafed to all, not onely without the viſible Church, but much more within the Church, where by the cleare light of the Holy Scripture all may and ought to know particularly, whatſoever is meet for their ſoules health. And this univerſall grace, I ſay further, wee ought to yeeld unto, becauſe without it, neither the pagans and infidels, nor yet the falſe Chriſtians can bee without excuſe. But that every one that knowes, doth of himſelfe according to this knowledge frame his will conſtantly, and effectually, to deſire whatſoever belongs to eternall life, <hi>Pelagius</hi> will never bee able to demonſtrate. For he that wils any thing conſtantly and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, wils alſo thoſe meanes conſtantly and effectually without which that thing cannot bee come unto. And becauſe without holineſſe no man can ſee the Lord, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. in whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence onely is the fullneſſe of bleſſing and joy for evermore, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.11. in the narrow path of which holineſſe becauſe the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Pagan and looſe living Chriſtian cannot nor will not walke, therefore they cannot bee ſaid effectually either to will, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire everlaſting life. But this is that ſpeciall grace reſerved for the veſſels of mercy, by which they are not inforced againſt their will, but of naturall men naturally unwilling, are made willing to follow Him that drawes them with the cordes of love, to love that which is pleaſing in his ſight, and ſo to will and deſire conſtantly and effectually to follow that which is for their ſoules health. So this deſire being wrought in them, by Him that is able to fulfill the deſire of them that feare Him, is a pledge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that their hope ſhall never bee aſhamed. And thus the weakeneſle of the aſſumption, and falſhood of the concluſion, doe plainely appeare.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. But hee is accounted a cruell creditor that will exact more then his debtor can pay: and hee a cruell Lord, that requires of his ſervant that which hee cannot performe. Therefore the moſt mercifull God requires of man no other ſatisfaction then that which man is able to performe. Anſwer. It is juſt that God ſhould require of man that he enabled him to performe. For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe His juſtice ſhould bee deficient or wanting towards Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: and his glory likewiſe unduely eſteemed. And the cruelty
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:107656:78"/>of a Creditor is to require more than a man is able to performe, by himſelfe or by his ſuretie. Therefore our moſt mercifull Lord foreſeeing the malice of the Devill, and the ſinne of man thereby, to the glory of His infinite grace, provided us a Saviour before we had ſinned: For whoſe abundant ſatisfactions ſake, wee have a doore of entrance as wide as the Valley of <hi>Achor</hi> ſet open unto us, that by His merit alone wee may come boldly unto the throne of grace, there to find helpe in the time of need.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE have ſeene the wretched eſtate of man to which he is ſubjected by reaſon of his ſinne, whereby he is unavoydably lya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto the wrath of God, which he is utterly unable to indure: and from which to eſcape there is no meanes in his owne power. Now conſider with thy ſelfe moſt wretched caitif, that art afraid to die becauſe thou haſt no hope but in this life, what it were for thee to ſtand iuſtly condemned to die, and every minute to expect the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of thy doome, if any one could be content to die for thee that thou mighteſt inioy the uſury of this aire but for the time of thy naturall life, from which thou knoweſt thou muſt part at laſt. But being ſubject to an infinite wrath, to an endleſſe puniſhment, the endurance of which but for one houre, hath more miſerie then the ſuffering of a thouſand untimely deathes: what love canſt thou owe to him? what thankes canſt thou give unto him, that would free thee from the puniſhment, and inſtead of that reſtore thee to an eſtate of life and ioy eternall? And ſeeing it hath appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that this cannot bee done by any one that is onely man; wee are now in this ſecond place to ſee what are the conditions of our Mediator; who by Himſelfe is able to make ſatisfaction for
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:107656:80"/>our ſinne. For ſeeing the juſt ſentence on man was, that for his owne ſinne hee ſhould die the death; which becauſe it was the word of an infinite ſpeaker, of an infinite truth: it muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity bee meant according to the uttermoſt extenſion of the truth, and ſo meane all death of body and ſoule, temporall, and eternall. And becauſe the Mediator for man could not endure a temporall or bodily death, except hee were man: therefore it ſhall firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare; That the Mediator for the ſinne of man muſt bee man. And becauſe eternall death is ſuch a thing as no man onely man can offer himſelfe unto, with hope or poſſibilitie by himſelfe to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, therefore it ſhall appeare in the ſecond place; That our moſt glorious Mediator muſt bee God: who being of infinite life, wiſdome, and power, knew how to conquer eternall death; that having in the infinite worthineſſe of his owne perſon ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the infinite juſtice for the ſinne of man, Hee might give eternall life to all them that by true faith ſhould lay hold on His merits; and in thankefulneſſe for that unſpeakeable mercy live in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his commandements. And that it may appeare what the ſuperexcellency of the knowledge of our moſt holy faith in the religion of Chriſt is, and that for the worthineſſe and glory there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it farre ſurpaſſeth all knowledge of all things which men or angels can come unto: it ſhall be made plaine in the third place, how neceſſary and agreeing to the wiſdome, goodneſſe, and glory of God it was; That God ſhould be incarnate. Great is the myſtery of godlineſſe, into which the angels deſire to looke. And becauſe our moſt glorious Light and guide, hath in his Holy word made theſe things ſo manifeſt unto us, let us with chearefulneſſe and joy in the ready ſervice of our beſt underſtanding, follow him who in our fleſh hath reconciled all things to himſelfe, and in our fleſh hath led captivity captive, and triumphed over principalities and all powers of the enemy; that we being delivered, might ſerve himin holineſſe and righteouſneſſe all the daies of our life, and be accepted of Him in life everlaſting.</p>

And whatſoever is againſt the juſtice of God, is alſo againſt his wiſdome, his godneſſe and power: for wee have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die proved that all theſe dignities are in him one moſt ſimple and abſolute being <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. And whatſoever is againſt the power of God, is utterly impoſſible to be: therefore it muſt neceſſarily follow, either that there is no reconciliation of man unto God, contrarie to that which hath beene proved in the 18. <hi>Chap.</hi> or elſe that this reconciliation muſt be made by a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour that is man. Therefore the Father ſaid fitly hereto, <hi>Propterea nobis per Mediatorem praeſtita eſt gratia, ut polluti carne peccati, carnis peccati ſimilitudine mundaremur. Auguſt. de Civitate Dei lib.</hi> 10. <hi>Cap.</hi> 22.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. God might ſeeme towards man an accepter of perſons, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Angels that ſinned, ſevere and mercileſſe, if hee ſhould condemne them to the paynes of eternall fire, and yet accept man to mercy, when no ſatisfaction had beene made for mans ſinne in the nature that had ſinned. But both theſe things are utterly impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and againſt the juſtice of God: therefore the puniſhment of the ſinne of man muſt be borne in the nature of man.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The iuſt Law and ſentence of the moſt wiſe Lawmaker and juſt judge ought to ſtand ſure and inviolable. But the ſentence of death was decreed and pronounced againſt man, if hee ſinned <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. Therefore by man is the expiation and ſatisfaction to bee made for ſinne.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Every reſtoring of any want or corruption in nature muſt be by that which is of the ſame kinde, as if any fleſh in man be rotten, the member is not made whole againe but by the ſupply of ſound fleſh in ſtead thereof. If a bone be broken, the breach is not made up with a ſticke, nor a cut ſinew by a catlin; ſo the nature of man being corrupted by the diſobedience of one, could not be reſtored againe but by the obedience of one in whom the nature of man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſtored, all that are partakers of his incorruption may alſo be partakers of his immortalitie: becauſe mans nature doth not now ſtand abſolutely condemned in Gods juſtice as before.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. This argument the Apoſtle urgeth 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.21. For ſince by man came death, by man alſo came the reſurrection of the dead.

                           <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat the Angels in glorie with ſuch perfections as they had, ſhould ſinne malitiouſly, when there was no tempter, makes their ſinne without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, and them in juſtice unpardonable: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the ſinne of man in compariſon of theirs may ſeeme much leſſe and more pardonable, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of that low eſtate of mens creation in compariſon of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; that his ſinne was not malitious; nor without a Tempter: yet when it is well thought on, how hatefull a thing to God ſinne is, how His pure eyes cannot behold ungodlineſſe and wrong, how his infinite iuſtice is violate thereby; and what iealouſie ſo glorious and infinite a being ought to have of his owne honour, ſo ſet at nought by ſo baſe and unworthie a thing as man, who alſo by that ſinne of his diſordered the whole creature, ſo farre forth as it was for his uſe, and made it ſubject to vanitie and corruption: it may well appeare of what an infinite difficultie it was to reſtore man to that favour and grace from which hee had fallen. For in beings of which one is finite, the other infinite, there muſt bee an infinite difference; and if they bee of contrarie conditions, the one pure and righteous, the other ſinnefull and impure, that contrarietie muſt needs likewiſe be infinite, and an infinite contrarietie can no way be accorded or reconciled, but by an infinite concord, which cannot be but in Him which is partaker both of the finite and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite being. And becauſe it hath before appeared <hi>chap.</hi> 18. That man was to be reſtored to the favour of God, and to be reconciled againe unto him, it muſt follow neceſſarily that this peacemaker muſt be both God and man. For infinitie is with the greateſt great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of being, and containes all the extremities thereof, and ſuch is the Being of God: but the Creature being finite is ſet at an infinite diſtance from that which is infinite, and therefore in a leſſeneſſe of being, as having no being at all of it ſelfe, but only imparted by that infinite being, from which degree of participation, if it fall, as man did by his ſinne, it ſtill falls unto a further leſſeneſſe or badneſſe of eſtate, and ſo becomes utterly deſperate, except it be upheld as man
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:107656:81"/>was by that hope, <hi>The ſeed of the woman ſhall bruiſe the Serpents head.</hi> And ſeeing the greateſt greatneſſe of being, and the leaſt littleneſſe of being cannot bee accorded, but by an equalitie of being, which cannot bee but in that which doth equally participate both of that greatneſſe and that littleneſſe, that is, eſſentially: therefore it is moſt neceſſarie that our gracious Mediatour bee eſſentially both God and man, which will yet further appeare by theſe reaſons that follow.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That all mankinde by the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> is deprived of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and glorie of God, hath beene proved in the 17. <hi>Chapter,</hi> and that there is a reſtoring of mankinde, was ſhewed in the 18. <hi>Chap.</hi> Now if it bee not in the power of man or of any other finite being to reſtore man being fallen into the favour of God, it followes of neceſſitie that the Mediatour or reſtorer muſt bee God. But the firſt was abundantly proved in the 19. <hi>Chapter, Ergo</hi> the ſecond fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes of neceſſitie.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. For every infinite offence an infinite amends muſt needs bee made, or elſe there is no ſatisfaction. The ſinne of man was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite offence, <hi>See Chap.</hi> 19. <hi>Anſw. to the</hi> 1. <hi>Object.</hi> But an infinite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends could not be made by a finite creature: <hi>Ergo</hi> the Mediatour for the ſinne of man muſt bee God. And although God cannot ſuffer at all, yet becauſe the puniſhment due to man for ſinne was more than any man was able to beare; it was neceſſarie that the manhood in that conflict ſhould bee upheld by the Godhead, that the ſinne being balanced by the puniſhment, the worthineſſe of the perſon might make the ſuffering of infinite merit for the ſinnes of of the whole world.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. No effect can bee eternall but by a cauſe that is eternall: for whatſoever is this or that by accident, muſt of neceſſitie be made ſuch by that which is ſuch of it ſelfe. But the reſtoring of man is to an eſtate of life and happineſſe which is to bee eternall (as it will further appeare in the Article of <hi>Everlaſting life</hi>) therefore it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie that it bee wrought by a cauſe which is alſo eternall. But it is proved that nothing can bee eternall but God alone: therefore the reſtorer of mankinde muſt be God.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The enemie of mans everlaſting ſalvation is the devill, a moſt powerfull enemie, whoſe power is yet greater againſt man becauſe he pleades the juſtice of God againſt ſinners: therefore it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, that the authour and finiſher of our ſalvation ſhould bee God and man, that he might be able both to ſatisfie the infinite ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and by a greater power of his owne, to withſtand the great power of the devill.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Contrarie cauſes muſt have contrarie effects, and ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie effects muſt have contrarie cauſes, and one of theſe is ever knowne and diſcerned by the other, ſo that man by his ſinne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubject to death, when it appeares what mans diſeaſe or ſinne was, the remedie likewiſe will be manifeſt: but it is plaine that
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:107656:82"/>man being not content with his eſtate would bee God, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares firſt by the temptation of the devill, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.5. <hi>In the day that ye eat thereof, ye ſhall be as God knowing good and ill.</hi> Then by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>verſe</hi> 6. <hi>And the woman ſeeing that the tree was to bee deſired to make one wiſe, ſhee tooke of the tree and did eate.</hi> If then the ſickeneſſe were this, that man would bee God, the onely medicine muſt be this, that God would bee man: therefore the mediatour would be both God and man.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. To require ſatisfaction for the ſin of man from God, was to require that which was not due, and that is againſt juſtice. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the ſatisfaction of man, was more then hee could performe, and that is againſt mercie: therefore that the worke both of juſtice and mercie might bee perfect, it was neceſſarie that the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour for the ſinne of man ſhould in one perſon bee both God and man: for as gold is molten in the fire becauſe it hath parts that may bee made running, yet by reaſon of the puritie and perfection of thoſe parts it cannot be conſumed by the moſt violent flames; ſo our Lord becauſe hee was truly man did feele and endure the pangs of moſt bitter death, and was compaſſed about with the ſorrowes of hell, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.6. yet for the innocencie of his manhood, and the glorie of his deitie, he could not be overcome thereby.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. It is impoſſible that a pure creature ſhould have ſuch ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of merit, that in Gods juſtice the ſanctification of mankinde ſhould be due to thoſe merits, becauſe all holineſſe that can come to any creature, whether of vertue or of workes, muſt come thereto from God: ſo no praiſe or merit can in juſtice bee due to any man for that which God hath wrought by him: therefore the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of mankinde muſt be God.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Every particular man being onely man, is of much leſſe worth than the whole race of mankinde, and ſo inſufficient in juſtice to make a ſufficient ſatisfaction for the ſins of all men: therefore that all mankinde might be freed from their ſins both originall and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, it was neceſſary that the Mediator who ſhould make ſatisfaction for their ſinnes, ſhould be both man, from whom the ſatisfaction was due, and yet of more worthineſſe then all mankinde, that his merit might make the ranſome ſufficient for the ſinnes of all men. But nothing is of more worth then all mankinde, but God alone: therefore the Mediatour for mans ſinne muſt bee God. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Angels bee more excellent then man according to the condition of their preſent being, yet not in reſpect of the end of their creation. Firſt, in that they are miniſtring ſpirits for mans ſake, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. Secondly in regard of their common end, in that both the one and the other are to bee bleſſed in God alone. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, And if any one man cannot bee accounted more worthie then any of the whole kinds of beings that were created, as our Lord ſaid, <hi>Yee are more worth then may ſparrowes Luke</hi> 12.7. He ſaid not all (for no ſpecies in the creature may be miſſing) and yet the health of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:107656:82"/>one man was priz'd above the life of 2000 ſwine <hi>Mar.</hi> 5.2.13. How can any thing beſide the Creator himſelfe bee more worthie then all mankinde?</p>
                        <p n="9">9. The greateſt benefit which God could beſtow upon man muſt of neceſſitie be by the greateſt gift which hee could give vnto him. The greateſt benefit was in this, to ſave and redeeme him when hee was utterly loſt. The greateſt gift which he could give to man was himſelfe: therefore it was neceſſarie that God ſhould become one with man, that in man he might ſave man that was loſt.</p>

Some other thinke they were not rejected for any one offence, but for three offences and for foure, that is, for continuall rebellion they were not ſpared; and ſo for many ages before mans creation, they were adjudged to the paines of eternall fire; though the execution of their ſentence be prorogued, untill the number of the ſonnes of pride be utterlie fulfilled. Of this you may ſee <hi>Poſtell. de Nat.

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:107656:83"/>although it cannot know what the originall of things is, according to all their orders of cauſes, yet by the effects will it be prying into the cauſes of them.

That finding himſelfe in the firſt order of the creature, he thought that God (who out of his infinite goodnes purpoſed to bring all the underſtanding creature to the uttermoſt happineſſe which it could be capable of, which could not bee but in the uniting of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture unto God: for God in his abſolute and infinite being could not be come unto, nor apprehended, much leſſe be enjoyed by a finite creature, except hee would be pleaſed to dwell in a creature that was finite) and therefore (I ſay) hee thought that God ſhould rather dwell in the being of the Angels, and in their nature gather all things unto himſelf; then dwelling in the tabernacle of the manly being: in which hope ſeeing himſelfe fruſtrate, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came an unreconcileable enemy to mankinde, whereas the holy Angels eſteeming duely of the benefit, and being well content with that meanes whereby God would bee ſeene of them, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. expect with patience, and deſire the fulfilling of the number of the elect. And thus our Lord hauing made mans peace through the bloud of his croſſe, hath reconciled all things both in heaven and earth unto God. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20. For certainely if the Angels be for man; as it is ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. then can they not poſſibly have the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their bleſſedneſſe but by man. Let us therefore with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and thankfulneſſe come unto that great myſterie of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, <hi>That God was manifeſt in the fleſh.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The incarnation of God, is the dwelling of the Godhead in the manhood in one perſon, wherein the being of the Godhead and manhood remaine together everlaſtingly, without ſeparation, yet in cleere diſtinction of their ſeverall beings; and ſo without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtion to cauſe a third being, but that each continuing truly that which it is in it ſelfe, the Godhead according to his eternall decree, without any change of it ſelfe, in time tooke to it ſelfe the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; that by himſelfe hee might reconcile all things to himſelfe, and bring them to that eſtate of happineſſe and glorie, to which they could never have come, if God had not ſo manifeſted himſelfe in the fleſh.</p>
                        <p>The internall actions of the eternall Deity are all infinite, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and neceſſary to be that which they are. But whatſoever God doth worke without himſelfe in the creature, it is onely according to his owne holy pleaſure and will. But yet ſeeing his actions upon the creature are the expreſſions of thoſe perfections which are in himſelfe, of goodneſſe, of wiſdome, of power, of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, &amp;c. and that to this end, that the creature may bee bleſſed in him, and by him, according to that meaſure of happineſſe
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:107656:83"/>which he of his goodneſſe hath appointed thereto: therefore thoſe reaſons which are drawne from the dignities of God, are of no leſſe force for the truth of God in the creature, then they were for the manifeſtation of the truth in himſelfe. And therefore as by thoſe dignities which by the authority of his word are due to him, wee have approved that truth which the holy Scripture teacheth us to beleeve of him, both concerning the unitie of his being, and the Trinitie of the Perſons; ſo let us endeavour in the proofe of this great queſtion. And although the great maſters in the ſchoole have given ouer theſe queſtions as utterly beyond all proofe or teſtimony of humane underſtanding, <hi>See Thom. Aquin. praef. in lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cont. Gent.</hi> yet ſeeing this is that maine point in our moſt holy faith, whereby it differs moſt from all infidelity and falſe worſhips; ſeeing it is that one thing wherein the ground of all our future hope and comfort doth conſiſt: if ever the underſtanding of a Chriſtian held it ſelfe bound to doe ſervice unto his faith, moſt of all it is bound to give attendance herein. I may ſomtimes uſe the word of neceſſity in the concluſions following; yet underſtand me not as if I laid any neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie or conſtraint upon God to doe or to ſuffer; but the neceſſitie that I meane, is in the conſequence of the reaſon, when the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion doth follow neceſſarily upon the grounds that are laid downe before.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. For although happines be only in the enjoying of that which is good, and the greater the good is, the greater is the happines; but if the good be not enjoyed and poſſeſſed, it cauſes no happines at all; yet an infinite good is no way to bee come unto or poſſeſſed by that which is finite, except by the voluntarie motion and inclination of it ſelfe, it doe apply and give it ſelfe unto that which is finite. And becauſe every good ſpreads it ſelfe acccording to the power of it ſelfe, upon that which is capable of it, the greateſt goodneſſe is ever with the greateſt communication of it ſelfe: therefore the infinite goodnes doth alſo extend it ſelfe according to the poſſibilitie of the creature to be poſſeſſed and enioyed thereby; which cannot be till it have applied it ſelfe to ſomething in the creature, of which the reſt of the creatures being partakers, may alſo thereby be partakers of the infinite goodneſſe. Now if God who onely is infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, had dwelt in the being of the Angels (though that had beene made knowne to man) yet becauſe man doth not communicate with the Angels in nature, or by any merit or ſervice towards them, he had had no benefit thereby, whereas the Angels by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their miniſterie to mankinde in their continuall preſence and ſuccour, and that helpe which the ſoule hath by them in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery thereof out of this priſon of the body, and in the conducting of it unto the Divine preſence, have in iuſtice a reward for their ſervice ſake, and a kinde of intereſt in all that good whereof man by their miniſterie is made partaker.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Moreover when man had ſinned, the law of juſtice required
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:107656:84"/>that the ſatisfaction ſhould be made in that nature that had ſinned, ſo that if the Mediatour had taken on him the nature of Angels, the ſatisfaction therein had not beene avayleable for the ſinne of man.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Thirdly, the whole creature hath intereſt in man, and man in the whole creature; ſo that God by taking on him the nature of man, hath bleſſed therby the whole creature, as you may underſtand by the anſwer which is made <hi>Cha.</hi> 17. <hi>to the</hi> 5 <hi>Object.</hi> §. 4. But if he had the nature of Angels, neither man, nor the other elementall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures had had hope of any reſtoring. <hi>See Rom.</hi> 8.19. <hi>&amp;c. to</hi> 23.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Laſtly if the deliverance of man had beene made in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Angels, the reſtoring had beene as unſufficient, ſo alſo man had loſt of his dignitie and honour thereby: for man before his ſinne was bound and ſubjected to God alone; but then had hee beene ſubjected and bound to the nature of Angels. And although man by his ſinne, nay even our Lord himſelfe by his ſuffering for ſinne, was made ſomewhat lower then the Angels; yet being raiſed from the dead, the manly nature is exalted far above all principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and power, and might, and every name that is named in this world, or in the world which is to come <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.20.21. Whence it will follow neceſſarily that God would dwell in the nature of man, not in the Angels, as you may underſtand by theſe Scriptures. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Foraſmuch as the children are partakers of fleſh and blood: he alſo himſelfe likewiſe tooke part of the ſame. ver.</hi> 16. <hi>Hee tooke not on him the nature of Angels, but hee tooke on him the ſeed of</hi> Abraham. And for their attendance is it not ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Are they not all miniſtring Spirits ſent forth to miniſter for them who ſhall bee heires of ſalvation?</hi> Compare herewith <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.7. and 91.11. and conclude with Saint <hi>Paul</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.23. <hi>All things are yours, and yee are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The queſtions before are neere to this (as all the Articles of our faith are neceſſarie conſequents one of another) therefore let us briefely ſee by that which is already proved, what we can gather to this concluſion.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Either the whole race of mankinde muſt be loſt and periſh being tainted with the ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> or the infinite juſtice againſt which the ſinne was done, muſt for ever ſtand violated and broken, or elſe a Mediator muſt bee found who was able to ſatisfie the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite juſtice that was offended. The firſt is againſt the wiſdome, goodneſſe, and love of God to his creature; either to make man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde in vaine, that is to deſtroy it againe, or to make it unto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall puniſhment. The ſecond is impoſſible, that an infinite juſtice infinitely able to avenge it ſelfe ſhould endure it ſelfe for ever to to remaine violate and offended: for ſo ſhould it prize a thing fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and wicked, before it ſelfe infinite in juſtice: therefore there behoves to be a Mediatour who ſhould fully ſatisfie the juſtice of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, and utterly blot out the guilt of ſinne. Now an infinite juſtice offended muſt be ſatisfied by a puniſhment anſwerable, that
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:107656:84"/>is infinite: but no finite creature could any way be, or be accounted infinite. Therefore <hi>when none was found worthy either in heaven, or in earth, or under the earth; the Lambe ſlaine from the beginning of the world tooke upon him our fleſh,</hi> to ſatisfie for the ſinne of his creature, and ſo by his infinite obedience (for by His eternall ſpirit Hee offered himſelfe to God. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. and by the infinite merit of his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, for by that ſpirit the manhood both ſoule and fleſh was ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to endure thoſe pangs, and that puniſhment which neither all mankinde, nor any other creature could endure) was the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite juſtice ſatisfied. And thus <hi>Hee became mighty to ſave.</hi> Eſay 63.1. and <hi>having Himſelfe in his owne body borne our ſinnes vpon the tree, did utterly aboliſh the whole body of ſinne, and found for us eternall redemption.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. The divine goodneſſe hath created all things exceeding good, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. ſo much doth it delight it ſelfe in that concordance or agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is betweene the inward and the outward good. But that agreement is the greateſt which is in the unity of one perſon. Therefore it is expedient that there be an incarnation, that ſo in one perſon the goodneſſe may bee moſt eminent, and the concord moſt lovely.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Otherwiſe you may propoſe it thus. The excellency of the effect appeares by that conformity or agreement which it hath with the cauſe: ſo then the inward worke of the infinite Goodneſſe, and the outward being accorded in the unity of one perſon; the multiplication of the agreement is ſo great, that it cannot poſſibly bee greater. Therefore it followes that the Godhead bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate: for otherwiſe the concord in the inward and outward worke of the deity, might bee greater than it is, but that is impoſſible.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The divine will concerning his workes without, doth will and love that eſpecially, wherein the excellency of all his inward dignities doth moſt appeare. But the excellency of all his digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties appeares moſt in this, that God bee manifeſt in the fleſh. For <hi>thereby we are made partakers of the Divine nature,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, vertue, everlaſting life, and happineſſe: So that now there is but one end of God, and his creature, that is the glory of God, of which and unto which God rejoyces over his dreature to bring it, and make it partaker: And the Creature likewiſe reioyces to be made partaker. And thus the end or perfection of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath reſt or accompliſhment in the inward perfections of God, and his inward perfections are manifeſt in his outword workes. Therefore God would bee incarnate.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. And ſeeing that God infinitely bleſſed and happy in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe needed not the Creature; but made it therefore that it might be bleſſed in him; and that of his fullneſſe the creature might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that fulneſſe of happineſſe which it can poſſibly injoy: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is requiſite that that fulneſſe of his bee imparted unto that
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:107656:85"/>creature wherein all the reſt of the creature hath intereſt, which we have already proved to bee man, <hi>chap.</hi> 17. §. 4. <hi>ob.</hi> 5. Therefore God would dwell in man, that by man the whole creature might be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Him.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. If God were not incarnate, then the divine dignities ſhould be leſſe Infinite one than another. For the infinite goodneſſe, by the infinite wiſdome, ſeeing that uttermoſt and perfect happineſſe that might come unto man by the incarnation; if his power, his will, and love of the creature did not anſwer thereto; ſo that he would bee pleaſed to dwell in his creature: then ſhould they be defective, and of leſſe extent than his infinite wiſdome. But that is impoſſible. Therefore it followes that God would be incarnate. See the anſwer to the objection that may be made from hence, §. 1. on the 39 chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>n.</hi> 4.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. If there were not an incarnation, then the infinite wiſdome ſhould not have the view of that higheſt excellencie which is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be in the creature: neither ſhould the infinite power magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it ſelfe by the multiplication of it ſelfe in an outward ſubject; ſo theſe dignities ſhould not be glorious by all thoſe meanes whereby it is poſſible that they might glorifie themſelves. But all theſe things are inconvenient. Therefore it is reaſonable to beleeve the incarnation, leſt ignorance, weakeneſſe, and defect of glory ſhould bee found in the firſt principle, which muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity take away His infinity, proved chapter 3. underſtand the reaſon well. For your more eaſe, I will propoſe it affirmatively thus.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. If there bee an Incarnation, then the divine underſtanding may have an outward object wherein it may be infinite both in the inward and outward working. For whereas all created obiects are abſolutely finite: yet if the Divine being underſtood, which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore we called the Sonne, <hi>chap.</hi> 11. take on him our being, our nature by that aſſumption is deified, and ſo made infinite with that uttermoſt infinitie, whereof the Creature can any way bee capable ſeeing the deity is neither without the humanity nor the humanity without the deity. And ſo the divine underſtanding may be an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward obiect infinite, as much as it is poſſible that a creature can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite. And ſo the wiſdome alſo may bee infinite in all poſſibility of infinity both in the inward and outward working. And what I have ſaid of the infinite wiſdome of God, muſt alſo be underſtood of all his other perfections, of goodneſſe, of power, of eternity, of life, of glory, &amp;c. But if there bee no incarnation, this infinite out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward obiect is taken away, and ſo the underſtanding and all the other dignities of God, as concerning their outward working muſt be in littleneſſe and lower than that poſſibility whereto they may come. But this is not to be affirmed. Therefore the incarnation fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth reaſonably.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. Every efficient the more noble and excellent it is,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:107656:85"/>the greater and more excellent are the effects which it doth bring forth. But the greateſt effects are not brought to paſſe but by the greateſt meanes. Now there is no efficient more noble or excellent than God, no effect better or greater to the Creature, nor more honourable to the Creator, than the everlaſting happineſſe of his Creature: no means greater or more effectuall than that he become one with his creature. Therefore that the creature may bee happy in Him, and his honour and praiſe perfected in the Creature: it was expedient that God ſhould dwell in His Creature even in Man.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. By how much any efficient is greater in power, by ſo much more effectually doth it worke to magnifie the end of his worke, and ſo to ſet it free from littleneſſe, contempt and unworthineſſe of himſelfe. From which contempt and unworthineſſe the creature is ſet furtheſt, when it is deified, and God himſelfe is become one with man. So the incarnation is the moſt glorious worke which can bee wrought in the creature. To denie then the indwelling of God, in his creature, were to deny the moſt glorious worke of God: to put an infinite emptineſſe betweene God and his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wherein no meane ſhould bee; and ſo to exclude the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from all acceſſe unto the Creator, which were to put the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in everlaſting contempt, and unworthineſſe of the Creator ſo infinite and glorious. For the creature being ſet at an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite diſtance from the happineſſe which is in the Creator, ſhould have no meane whereby it might partake of the infinite glory. For no perfection in the Creature being ſimply and abſolutely finite, can bee partaker of that which is infinite without the Mediator God and man, as it is ſaid, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.6. <hi>No man commeth to the Father but by mee.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="11">11. It is to bee held that God the moſt wiſe workemaſter of all things ſhould in the creation of the world propoſe to Himſelfe the moſt noble and excellent end: which muſt bee concerning Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, the manifeſtation of His owne dignities and perfections in the Creature: and towards the Creature the greateſt perfection which was poſſible to be therein. But if there bee no incarnation, neither of theſe things could be performed. Not the firſt, becauſe the divine goodneſſe might have done a better worke in his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: his infinitie a greater; his glory a more excellent, &amp;c. Not the ſecond, for ſeeing God is that ſuperexcellent Goodneſſe of which every thing according to the meaſure thereof, deſires to be partaker: and by man may bee partaker, in as much as man participates with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very other thing, and every other thing being with him, if there bee no incarnation, this deſire of the Creature is vaine, the end thereof fruſtrate, and thereby it is ſubjected to eternall paine, the hoped end being impoſſible to bee attained unto. But all theſe things are inconvenient. Therefore it is requiſite that God bee incarnate.</p>
                        <pb n="140" facs="tcp:107656:86"/>
                        <p n="12">12. God is infinitely good, <hi>chap.</hi> 4. and ſo the moſt lovely being without compariſon. And therefore are wee moſt juſtly charged, <hi>to love Him with all our heart, with all our ſoule, with all our might, Deut.</hi> 6.5. But God would not require to be wholly and perfectly loved by man except He himſelfe did that for man by which Hee might moſt of all deſerve mans love; For otherwiſe he might ſeeme to require of man beyond that which were due, and ſo the perfection of that love ſhould bee founded in the goodneſſe and kindeneſſe of man toward God, not in the goodneſſe and mercy of God toward man. But this is not ſo. <hi>For wee love God becauſe Hee loved vs firſt, and gave His Sonne to bee the propitiation for our ſinnes.</hi> 1 Ioh. 4.10. If then God have done that for us, by which above all other things He might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our Loves, and that nothing can ſo much deſerve our Loves, as if he would be pleaſed to become one with us: it was expedient that God would be incarnate.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. That there is an eternall life both in ſoule and body, will appeare hereafter: in the meane time it ſhall be but a ſuppoſition. Now in eternall life it is neceſſary that the manly being attaine to the uttermoſt perfection both of the ſoule and body, that as his underſtanding, ſo his outward ſenſes be alſo moſt pure and perfect. But if there were no incarnation (ſeeing the divine glory in it ſelfe is utterly unapprehenſible by our ſenſes, and by our underſtanding) neither our underſtanding, nor our ſences could have any object wherein to reſt and ſabbatize, and being created without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying of their uttermoſt felicity they would bee the originall of miſery and ſorrow, when as they ſhould bee fit to receive the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of all intellectuall, and ſenſible formes from an agent naturall and ſupernaturall, as the Mediator is, and yet received it not. So alſo the divine glory ſhould not cauſe happineſſe, nor be inioyed by all poſſible meanes whereby it may cauſe happineſſe, and bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed by a meane naturall and ſupernaturall. But if there be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, then the infinite glory dwelling in this mediator, may be apprehended and inioyed, and make the Creature happie by all meanes whereby it is poſſible to be happie. Therefore God would dwell in his Creature. And this argument (I ſuppoſe) may ſtand well with that ſcripture, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.18. and 20. verſes; where to that requeſt of <hi>Moſes, That he might ſee the glory of God;</hi> it was anſwered, that no man can ſee it and live. By which it followes that after death when man is utterly ſeparate from ſinne he may ſee, and ſhall be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of that promiſe which is in <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God:</hi> which bleſſing is more particularly deſcribed. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.9.10. <hi>They that put their truſt under the ſhadow of his wings ſhall be abundantly ſatisfied,</hi> made drunke, as ſome reade it, others <hi>plenteouſly moiſtened with the fatneſſe of thy houſe, and thou ſhalt make them drinke of the river of thy pleaſures, &amp;c.</hi> all which the faithfull ſhall ſee and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy to the full in the Mediator God and Man, without whom there is no approaching unto God. And as this argument is good for
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:107656:86"/>the ſoule and underſtanding, ſo is it for the outward ſenſes; For if the bodily, ſenſes make for the increaſe of puniſhment in them that are damned: ſo ſhall they alſo bee for the increaſe of happineſſe in them that are ſaved. If you deſire moe arguments to this purpoſe you may conſider them in the 21. chapter. The authorities of the holy Scripture may bee ſeene in the end of the chapter following.

Behold the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and the heavens of heavens cannot containe Him, how much leſſe a houſe of clay whoſe foundation was in the duſt, yet doth wiſdome take her ſolace in the compaſſe of His earth, and her delight is with the Sonnes of Men,</hi> Prou. 8.31. So the <hi>Word was made fleſh and dwelt in us,</hi> Ioh. 1.14. <hi>And though he were in the forme of God, and thought it no robbery to be equall to God;</hi> yet as man had beene made in his likeneſſe and loſt it: ſo would hee bee made in the likeneſſe of man, and to reſtore that firſt image unto man, <hi>became obedient unto death, even the death of the croſſe,</hi> Phil. 2.6.7.8. O Holy and moſt bleſſed teacher of our moſt glorious faith! what high doctrine? what holy myſteries? what pretious promiſes doth the Chriſtian faith containe? That which is infinite dwels in in that which is finite; the circumference in the centre. The greateſt of beings, and the leaſt are one. Two births eternall and tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and but one Sonne. And becauſe the eſſentiall proprieties of both natures doe ſtill remaine, he that is the Father of eternity is become a childe, <hi>Eſay</hi> 9.6. And hee that is the wiſdome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, increaſes in knowledge, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.52. hee that no place can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine doth grow in ſtature, and the Sonne of an eternall love, doth grow in favour with God and Man. In briefe, hee that hath all things with God the Father, ſave this that he is begotten, hath all things with man except his ſinne. But although there be two ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, and that of divers kindes; eternall, and in time, in which reſpect almoſt all things are double in him: yet is not hee two ſonnes; becauſe Sonneſhip reſpects not the diverſity of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures divine and humane; but onely the unity of the Perſon; ſo that if there be but one Perſon of both natures; there can be but one
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:107656:87"/>Son. Wherefore ſeeing the Sonne of God took on Him not the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but the nature of man: yet the whole nature body and ſoule of the ſubſtance of his Mother; And ſeeing that whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſubſiſts in the Perſon of the eternall Son; He, in both reſpects, both of his divine and humane generation, is ſtill the onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Sonne of the Father; onely begotten (I ſay) that he may be diſcerned from us that are adopted; only ſonne, becauſe we are not hereafter to looke for any other Saviour. His onely Sonne, not of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> or any man according to the fleſh. For as according to the law of the eternall life which is in God, He is begotten of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Father, not without, but in the Perſon of the Father, yet diſtinct therefrom: ſo according to that generation which was in time, was He begotten by the power of the Father, without the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Father, being conceived in the wombe of the virgin. For as a thing conceived in the minde of a man is the firſt word or expreſſion of his underſtanding, which being ſpoken or written becomes ſenſible and to bee underſtood of others; So the Sonne is in the Father that eternall word underſtood, conceived, or begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten before the worlds, and in the fullneſſe of time (not ceaſing to be eternally begotten as before) He was made manifeſt in the fleſh, even that word or life which was eternally with the Father, <hi>was ſeene with eyes, was looked upon, and was handled with hands,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.1.2. So that as there is but one Father both in the eternall and timely ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; ſo is there but one Sonne; by a moſt holy, moſt true, and ſubſtantiall generation God and Man, the Sonne of God, and the bleſſed virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> Now this one Sonne, one Chriſt, one Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel, one Mediator, one Perſon is ſuch, not by mixture, not by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, not by compoſition of the two natures, nor yet by change of one into another: but one by aſſumption or taking of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature into the divine, wherein the deity is to dwell eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally without ſeparation, but not without diſtinction. And theſe two natures ſo dwell together in the Perſon of our Saviour, as that for the unity of the Perſon, the attributes which belong to one nature are given to the other, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.13. <hi>No man hath aſcended up to heaven, but hee that came downe from heaven, even the Sonne of man which is in heaven.</hi> And againe, Acts 20.28. <hi>Feed the church of God which He hath purchaſed with his owne bloud.</hi> And although I ſaid before, <hi>chap.</hi> 11. that relation properly ſo called was not in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine generation but ſupereminent, becauſe all things here are coeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall, <hi rend="sup">a</hi> the ſubjects no other beings than the termes, that is the Father and the Sonne; the foundation alſo coeſſential, that is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and unconceiveable generation for the termes ſake in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther active, in the Sonne paſſive: And although in the ſecond ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, neither the ſubjects nor the termes are coeſſentiall, the ſubjects are the Perſon of the eternall word, and the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> the foundation is the generation whereby the manly being, paſſively was taken of the Virgin unto the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:107656:87"/>of the word: yet in reſpect of this hypoſtaticall union, or ioyning of the humanity unto the Perſon of the Eternall Sonne, <hi>Mary</hi> the mother of <hi>Ieſus</hi> is truely ſaid the mother of God; not that the Godhead tooke beginning from her, but becauſe ſhe brought out that manly being, which from the time of its firſt union was never ſeparated from the Godhead; And becauſe the ſuppoſition or perſon wherein both natures are, is one Chriſt: of which Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhe is truely called the mother, though ſhe be mother onely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleſh, as is ſaid, <hi>Math.</hi> 1.23. <hi>A virgin ſhall bring forth a Sonne, and they ſhall call his name God with us.</hi> And againe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. <hi>of the Iſraelites as concerning the fleſh came Chriſt, who is God bleſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all for evermore, Amen.</hi> But although there be one only Sonne; yet in reſpect of the two nativities Hee is truely called the Sonne of God, and the Sonne of the virgin, though with this difference, that by the eternall generation he tooke of the Father both his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall nature, and his Perſon, by which he is the ſonne of his Father by a ſupereminent reall relation; but of his mother he tooke in time the humane nature, but not any humane Perſon. And therefore this Sonſhip is only rationall, except it bee underſtood with the divine perſon, in which the humanity ſubſiſts, and ſo hee is truly ſaid this man, and the ſon of the virgin. For as <hi rend="sup">b</hi> he tooke on him the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, ſoule and body to dwell therein for ever, as the Evangeliſt ſpeaks, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.14.

                           </gap> and made his tabernacle in us: So did hee give unto the humane nature to bee one Perſon in him: So that God is now truely one with us, that wee hereafter may bee one with him, according to that prayer of our eternall mediator. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 17. <hi>I in them, and thou in mee, that they may bee one, as wee are one.</hi> So the advantage is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on our ſide: For the humane nature comming to our Lord in the perfection of the infinite deity, could adde nothing to His perfection, onely the infinite love of God toward man was perfected thereby, becauſe the humane nature being taken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sonne of his love, wee are aſſured thereby of his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall love, that <hi>Hee hath loved us, as Hee hath loved Him, Ioh.</hi> 17.23. Whereas if our Lord had aſſumed the perſon of any man, though therewith hee had taken alſo the common nature of mankinde, yet that Perſon had had perculiar intereſt in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall and infinite love, and wee had beene unequally ſubjected one to another: but now the common nature onely being ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto the deity, every perſon hath equall intereſt as in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon nature, ſo in the eternall love. Now let us ſee the reaſons of the propoſition.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It is neceſſary that all the actions of God be done according to the perfection of that order which is moſt fit and agreeable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe actions. But ſeeing it ſtood with the Love of God to dwell in mans being (as it hath bin proved) it was moſt convenient that the Sonne of God ſhould take our nature on him. For firſt the Son is the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:107656:88"/>image of God increated, man his created image; and that all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of an image might bee in the increated image, it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie that hee ſhould bee alſo the created image of his Father. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, ſeeing that by the eternall nativitie, hee is the eternall Sonne, that the perfection of all Sonne-ſhip might bee in him, it was neceſſarie that hee ſhould bee that Sonne that ſhould bee borne in time. Thirdly, and becauſe it pleaſed the Father that all fulneſſe ſhould dwell in him, <hi>Coloſsians</hi> 1. <hi>verſe</hi> 19. Seeing hee was brought forth by an eternall nativitie, hee muſt alſo perfect that nativitie which was in time. Fourthly, and becauſe all things both which are in heaven and in earth were created by him, it was neceſſarie that all things by him ſhould bee reſtored. Fifthly, Mans nature is the daughter of God, therefore being led away cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive by ſinne, was to be reſcued by his Sonne. Sixthly, Man fell from grace by the craft of the devill, therefore by the wiſdome of God was hee to be brought to favour againe. Seventhly, Mankinde is the peculiar poſſeſſion of the Sonne by the ſpeciall gift of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.2. therefore being loſt, it was to be recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by his ſpeciall purchaſe. And if there bee any other perſonall proprietie of the Sonne, of obedience, or the like, it ſorts better with him to bee incarnate than either with the Father or the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Ghoſt. All the arguments which prove that it was neceſſarie that Chriſt ſhould dye, may bee brought hither. <hi>See them in the</hi> 27. <hi>Chapter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. Nothing can bee admitted in the actions of the Deitie which takes away the diſtinction of their perſonall proprieties, ſeeing God is the author of order, not of confuſion. But if either the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or the holy Ghoſt had beene incarnate, then their perſonall proprieties were thereby in utter confuſion: for if the Father had beene incarnate, then ſhould hee not be eternally a Father, that had in time become a Sonne, ſo alſo neither the perfection of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood ſhould be in the Father, nor of Sonne-ſhip in the Sonne. And concerning the holy Ghoſt, ſeeing hee is that emanation, breath of effluence of the power, wiſdome, life, &amp;c. whereby the worke of God is perfected: if he ſhould have beene incarnate, the ſame being ſhould be both the worker, and the thing wrought. <hi>See Luke</hi> 1.35. But all theſe things are impoſſible: Therefore the Sonne of God onely tooke on him our fleſh.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The greateſt excellencie which God can love in himſelfe, is the image of himſelfe beheld in himſelfe, that is, the Sonne of his eternall love. The greateſt excellencie which God can love with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out himſelfe, is the image of himſelfe beheld in his creature. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is neceſſarie that the Sonne of his eternall love be alſo incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, that the love of God be moſt perfect toward his Sonne, with all perfections of love which can bee either within or without himſelfe.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. It was ſaid before <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. that the goodneſſe, infinitie, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:107656:88"/>wiſdome, and power of God, being viewed or objected to the infinite wiſdome by the infinite action of his underſtanding, was the Sonne. Now if the Sonne be incarnate, then the actions of all the divine dignities are perfected, and may be infinite both in their internall, and as much as may be, in their externall object. But if either the Father or holy Ghoſt had beene incarnate, then the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of thoſe dignities could not bee one; and if the object were not one, then could it not be beheld with one action of underſtanding. But it is impoſſible, either that there ſhould be two infinite objects, or two infinite actions. Moreover, if the holy Ghoſt had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate, then the infinite internall action ſhould have become the externall object: if the Father, then the fountaine of the Deitie ſhould become not the objectant, or being which underſtandeth, but onely the object underſtood. But all theſe things are impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: for God is not the author of confuſion; therefore it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie that the Sonne ſhould be incarnate.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. The doctrine concerning the Mediatour conteined in theſe foure Chapters, is as the ſubſtantiall ground of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; ſo is it that foundation on which all the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles have builded: for as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11. <hi>That which the Prophets by the ſpirit of Chriſt did ſearch into, was the time when the ſufferings of Chriſt ſhould be reveiled, and the glories that ſhould follow after.</hi> The ſumme then of the whole Scripture being to ſhew the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man by the death of our Saviour, God and man, the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities are not farre to ſeeke. Many of the texts of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you ſhall finde moſt excellently brought together and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by <hi>Iuſtine Martyr</hi> againſt the <hi>Iewes,</hi> in his dialogue of the truth of the Chriſtian Religion, which is intituled <hi>Tryphon.</hi> Some moſt evident texts you ſhall have out of the new Teſtament, and more hereafter as need is. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.16.17. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that hee gave his onely begotten Sonne, that whoſoever beleeveth in him, ſhould not periſh but have everlaſting life: for God ſent not his Sonne into the world to condemne the world; but that the world by him might bee ſaved. Gal.</hi> 4.4. <hi>But when the fulneſſe of time was come, God ſent forth his Sonne made of a woman, made under the Law, that hee might redeeme them that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, that wee might receive the adoption of ſonnes. Phil.</hi> 2.6.7. <hi>Chriſt Ieſus being in the forme of God, thought it no robbery to bee equall with God; but tooke on him the forme of a ſervant, and was made like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to man, and was found in ſhape like a man Coloſ.</hi> 1.13.14. <hi>God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered us from the power of darkeneſſe, and hath tranſlated us into the kingdome of his deare Sonne, in whom wee have redemption through his blood Col.</hi> 2.9. <hi>In Chriſt dwelleth the fulneſſe of the God head bodily</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Great is the myſterie of Godlineſſe, God was manifeſt in the fleſh, juſtified in the Spirit, ſeene of Angels, preached unto the Gentiles, beleeved on in the world, received up to glorie.</hi> 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.14. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall confeſſe that Ieſus is the Sonne of God, God dwelleth in him, and hee in God.</hi> By which texts it is plaine, that the Saviour of mankind muſt

For all the Perſons together make but one infinite ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Deitie. And therefore 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. it is ſpoken without any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Perſons, that God was manifeſt in the fleſh. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> To become man was a perſonall proprietie of the Sonne of God; for the incarnation was not of the Godhead, wherein the Perſons are one; but of that ſubſiſtence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which the three Perſons are diſtinguiſhed. So that as in the Trinitie there be three perſons in one nature; ſo in the myſterie of the incarnation there is one perſon in two natures.

                        <p n="1">1.

                        <p n="2">2. If this Ieſus whom wee acknowledge bee the Saviour of the world, then the expectation of the moſt excellent and virtuous men is quieted, and at reſt in the aſſurance of his heavenly promiſe. But if this bee not hee, but that the Saviour is yet to come (for wee have already proved that man having ſinned ſhould be reſtored by a Saviour that ſhould bee both God and man) then ſince that time that Chriſt the Sonne of God and the virgin <hi>Mary</hi> came, wee that have beleeved in him, are in the greateſt errour that may bee, and all our hope in God (through the ſatisfaction of Chriſt) muſt bee aſhamed, all our beleefe in his word is vaine, and all the virtues, the conſtancie, love and patience of the Martyrs is periſhed; ſo that when that pretended <hi>Meſsiah</hi> ſhall come, he ſhall not be beleeved, or if he be beleeved, then Goſpell ſhall bee againſt Goſpell, faith againſt faith, love againſt love, hope againſt hope, virtue againſt virtue, and all this about the ſame thing, that is the meanes of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life. So the love of God toward his creature ſhould not bee manifeſt, in that hee had not made man to know aſſuredly that which concerned him moſt to know. So his juſtice ſhould finde no place to condemne the world of ignorance and misbeleefe. But all theſe things are abſurd and not to be granted: therefore this Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus the Sonne of the virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> is the Saviour of the world.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Religion is the band or obligation of the creature unto God to ſerve him, in hope of the excellencie of the reward. So that the moſt excellent Religion muſt give hope of the moſt high reward. Now if this Ieſus whom we confeſſe bee the Saviour of the world, the hope of the faithfull is at reſt, in the aſſurance of that hope of everlaſting life, in the uttermoſt perfection of all happineſſe and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:107656:90"/>joy. But if this be not he who was deſired before he came, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved on ſince his comming; then that Saviour when hee comes muſt give us aſſurance of greater hopes, and promiſes of greater joyes than yet wee have received. But this is impoſſible: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Ieſus in whom we beleeve is the Saviour of the world.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. It is neceſſary that the Saviour of mankinde doe love man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde with the uttermoſt perfection of love; ſo that for that loves ſake he offer himſelfe moſt willingly to the endurance of all thoſe things whereby he may procure the ſalvation of man, and the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt good which may befall him. And if this Ieſus whom wee confeſſe be not the Saviour of the world, then it is requiſite that the Saviour which is to come ſhould love mankinde more and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure greater things for man than he hath done. But this is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.13. <hi>&amp; Ioh.</hi> 10.15. Therefore this Ieſus our Lord is the Saviour of the world.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. It is impoſſible that the greateſt worke of God toward his creature, that is the ſalvation of mankinde ſhould be in vaine, or that the preaching of the truth thereof ſhould bee utterly unbeleeved. But if this Ieſus which the Chriſtian faith confeſſeth, be not the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the world, then the preaching of that truth when the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Saviour ſhould come, will not be beleeved: and ſo the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt worke of God toward mankinde will be in vaine, that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out glory to God and fruitleſſe to man, that will not receive it: for the Chriſtians know that ſalvation is in none other but onely in this Ieſus in whom they beleeve. And although the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> confeſſe many glorious things of Chriſt, as that hee is the power, wiſdome, breath, and word of God, borne of <hi>Mary</hi> a perpetuall vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin by a diuine inſpiring, that he raiſed the dead, and did all thoſe miracles which we affirme, and that he was the greateſt Prophet of all that were before him, as you may reade <hi>in Cuſa Crib. Alcor. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 12. <hi>Gul. Poſtel. de Concord. orbis lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Marſ. Ficin. de Rel. Chr. Cap.</hi> 12. <hi>and elſewhere.</hi> Yet they neither beleeve that hee did or could dye, or that it was neceſſary that hee ſhould, neither doe they beleeve that hee was the Sonne of God, which conditions wee have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proued to belong neceſſarily to the Saviour of the world. So that if he that ſhall come, do come according to theſe conditions, yet will they not receive him, no more than they receive Chriſt of whom they ſpeake ſuch honourable things. And concerning the Iewes; although it be manifeſt by the word of the Scripture, that the vaile ſhall at laſt be taken from their hearts, that they may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and be turned to our Lord the Saviour of the world, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.31. Yet ſeeing that our Lord in reſpect of his humilitie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came unto them a rocke of offence, and reſtored not the temporarie kingdome which they expected (for his kingdome was not of this world) If any other ſhall come in the ſame eſtate and condition, they will not beleeve. And concerning the idolatrous Gentiles, much leſſe will they beleeve, if they may ſay that the Chriſtians
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:107656:91"/>which beleeved before in ſuch a Saviour, were not ſaved by him: therefore the condition ſtands ſure; that if this Ieſus whom wee confeſſe be not the Saviour of the world, then that pretended Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour when hee comes ſhall not bee beleeved; and ſo the greateſt worke of God toward mankinde ſhould be in vaine.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. If this Ieſus in whom wee beleeve bee not the Saviour of the world, then the greateſt love and thankes which wee give unto God therefore, is leſſe lovely and leſſe acceptable; and the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men ſaved by this faith is leſſe willed of God than that leſſe love, thanks, and number of them which ſhall hereafter beleeve the truth: ſo the greater love ſhall bee deſpiſed for the leſſe, and the greater number miſpriſed for the leſſe: but this is not agreeable to the juſtice of God, and his love to his creature, and therefore not to be admitted: <hi>Ergo</hi> this Ieſus in whom we beleeve is the Saviour of mankinde.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. The ſuperexcellent or rather infinite height of that truth which wee profeſſe in the Articles of our faith concerning God the Creator, Redeemer, and Sanctifier of mankinde, and thoſe unſpeakeable benefits which we hope for in the life to come, is ſuch as no created underſtanding could have come unto, except God himſelfe by his word and ſpirit had firſt manifeſted the ſame unto man. And ſeeing it is the truth of God, the wiſdome and goodneſſe of God could not ſuffer that the full, perfect and moſt cleare manifeſtation thereof concerning the perſon by whom, and the time when it was to be fulfilled by his owne promiſe, ſhould bee by a falſe prophet, or that a falſe Chriſt ſhould take his honour to himſelfe, for ſo the moſt high truth ſhould ſuffer ſuch diſcredit thereby, as that it ſhould never bee beleeved. But this is abſurd and inconvenient. And therefore this Chriſt in whom wee beleeve is the true Chriſt, and the Saviour of the world.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. The whole time of the world is either for preparation to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Saviour when hee ſhall come, or manifeſtation of him when hee is come. But God hath long ſince ceaſed to prepare any people to receive him. And therfore the Saviour is already come: for although the Iewes expect a <hi>Meſsiah,</hi> yet have they no coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey nor forme of Religion appointed by God to uphold that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation: for the uſe of the ceremoniall Law, wherein the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi> was figured, was commanded onely in their owne land, out of which they being now baniſhed their ceremonies have no uſe. <hi>See Deut.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Ioſ.</hi> 5.5.7. <hi>Amos</hi> 5.25. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10. Therefore this Ieſus is the true <hi>Meſſiah.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="9">9 Neither may that argument bee omitted, whereby our Lord juſtified himſelfe. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.18. <hi>Hee that ſeeketh his glory that ſent him, the ſame is true.</hi> Seeing therfore that our Lord ſought not his own glory, but came in the greateſt humility, to endure the greateſt affliction, and moſt cruell death onely for the glory of his Father and the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:107656:91"/>ſalvation of mankind. And moreover, ſeeing God did ſeale unto his words that they were true, by thoſe glorious miracles which hee wrought by him, it followes in great probabilitie, that this Ieſus is the Mediatour by whom alone wee may come unto God, as hee teſtifieth of himſelfe. <hi>No man commeth to the Father but by me, Ioh.</hi> 14.6 and againe, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.3. <hi>This is eternall life to know thee the onely true God, and whom thou haſt ſent Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="10">10 <hi>(a)</hi> He unto whom all the prophecies of all the Prophets of the Old Teſtament concerning the Saviour to come doe agree, muſt needs be that true <hi>Meſſiah</hi> or Saviour of the world. But all the Prophecies of the Old Teſtament concerning the Saviour of the world, doe moſt preciſely agree unto this Ieſus whom the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an faith doth confeſſe, and to none other: therefore this Ieſus the Sonne of the virgin <hi>Mary</hi> is the Saviour of the world. For it cannot ſtand with the mercie of God to his creature; to give us ſignes whereby to know that which concernes us moſt to know, which ſhould not bee ſure and certaine: therefore the propoſition is manifeſt, and the Iewes the mſelues doe not gainſay it: the aſſumption will be manifeſt, if the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament bee compared with the hiſtorie of the New.

                        <p>A tenth argument from the prophecies of the old Teſtament, that this Ieſus our Lord is the Saviour that was promiſed <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. is from forreine circumſtances, and among them, firſt from the treaſon of <hi>Iudas</hi> propheſied <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41.9. <hi>and</hi> 53.13. fulfilled <hi>Math.</hi> 26.15. <hi>and</hi> 23. and with the hyre of his treaſon, the thirty pieces of ſilver, take the beſtowing of it propheſied in the 11. <hi>Chap. v.</hi> 12, 13. of <hi>Zachariah,</hi> Remember the Lord, by equivalence, <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt the Lord, becauſe he ought never to be remembred without his praiſe, fulfilled <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.7.10.

And although theſe perſecutions have beene more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and grievous at ſome time than other; as it may appeare by the bookes of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> and the ten perſecutions of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church foretold. <hi>Reu.</hi> 2.10. yet that rule holds, and ſtill ſhall, till that King doe come that ſhall reigne in Iuſtice, that all that will live godly in Chriſt muſt ſuffer perſecution, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12. For whether it bee that God by afflictions and perſecutions doth try the conſtancie and patience of his ſervants, and exerciſe their faith in his promiſes: or whether by trouble and perſecution, hee will teach them not to looke for their portion in this life: or to make them more conformable to the death of his Sonne, that they may alſo bee partakers of his reſurrection: or that the reward of their
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:107656:93"/>afflictions may bee with an exceeding waight of glory: or that in the life to come they may by compariſon inioy the fullneſſe of their happineſſe in more thankefullneſſe, and the perfection of love to the author thereof: or that the devil may in Iuſtice puniſh ſuch as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his obedience (for by the taint of originall ſinne wee all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came his vaſſalls) and God is not uniuſt no not to the devill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and therefore ſuffers him to afflict them, whom he himſelfe will comfort, <hi>Iob</hi> 1. <hi>Reu.</hi> 2.10. or whether the devil to keepe his owne vaſſals in firme obedience, doth more eagerly perſecute the truth: this is a ſure concluſion, that from <hi>Abel</hi> to this day, the truth of the Religion of Chriſt, and the obedient and faithfull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours thereof, have ever beene perſecuted, whereas all Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and ſuperſtition of how different kinds ſoever, hath beene and is freely exerciſed. From whence the reaſon will follow thus.</p>
                        <p>If the Religion of Chriſt, and the faith in him have onely beene perſecuted by the devill and his Inſtruments, even from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world untill now; then the faith in Chriſt is onely the true faith, and Hee the onely Saviour of the world. But the firſt is true by the teſtimony of the holy Scripture, and all thoſe hiſtories both eccleſiaſticall and prophane that write any thing concerning this matter; and the practice of the Turkes at this day doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it. Therefore the Faith in Chriſt is onely the true faith, and He the onely Saviour of the world.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. To this argument of the ſufferings for the faith of Chriſt you may take another from the hereſies that have beene there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. For as a malitious enemy beſieging a Caſtle impregnable poiſons the fountaine of which the defenders muſt needs drinke: ſo the faith of Chriſt being that onely fountaine of life, by which we are ſuſtained in our ſpirituall warfare, hath by the malice of the devill, beene troubled <hi rend="sup">g</hi> with all kindes of hereſies, which the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill could poſſibly forge by the wits of his Inſtruments: whereas in all the falſe worſhips that have beene in the world, no queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons nor diſſentions have beene, but every man wandred as hee was led, in the darkeneſſe of his fooliſh heart. And yet in all theſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, through the gratious direction of the Spirit of Chriſt, and the light of his word, the true faith hath prevailed, according to his promiſe, <hi>Math.</hi> 16.18. That all the devils that paſſe in and out at the gates of Hell ſhall not prevaile againſt it. From whence you may reaſon thus. That faith which onely hath beene attempted by all manner of hereſies to bee corrupted thereby, and yet hath ſtood uncorrupted and unreproveable in the True Faith. But the Chriſtian Faith onely is ſuch. Therefore the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith onely is the true Faith, and conſequently our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is the Saviour of the world; ſeeing in Him onely wee looke for redemption.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. And this is that pole of the Loadſtone whereto we may bee
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:107656:93"/>directed by every point within the compaſſe of the holy Scripture. And theſe pointers that follow are ſufficient to ſhew it, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.36. <hi>Let all the houſe of Iſrael know aſſuredly, that God hath made that ſame Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Chriſt, Act.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 10.11.12. <hi>There is no ſalvation in any other: for there is no name under heaven given among men whereby wee muſt be ſaved, ſave onely the name of Ieſus Chriſt of Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, whom God hath raiſed from the dead, Act.</hi> 16.31. <hi>Beleeve on the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and thouſhalt be ſaved and thy whole houſe, Act.</hi> 17.3. <hi>Paul o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened and proved that Chriſt muſt needes have ſuffered, and riſen againe from the dead: and this Ieſus whom I preach unto you is the Chriſt, Act.</hi> 18.28. <hi>He mightily convinced the Iewes and that publikely ſhewing by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that Ieſus was the Chriſt.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. <hi>other foundation can no man lay, than that is laid which is Ieſus Chriſt, Gal.</hi> 1.8.9. <hi>Though we or an Angel from heaven preach any other Goſpel to you than that you have received, let him be accurſed.</hi>

                              <hi>(b)</hi> Gen. 49.10. <hi>The Scepter ſhall not depart from Iuda, nor a Lawgiver from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene his feet untill Shiloh come; and unto Him ſhall the gathering of the people bee.</hi>] It is ſtrange to ſee what wretched ſhifts the wicked Iewes have to wreſt the true meaning of this place rather than they will acknowledge the truth that they might be ſaved. Some will have this <hi>Shiloh</hi> to be <hi>Saul,</hi> others <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> ſome <hi>Nebnchadnezer,</hi> as you may reade in <hi>Pet. Galat. lib.</hi> 3 <hi>cap.</hi> 4. But being convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by other prophecies and the authoritie of their owne doctors: they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that this <hi>Shiloh</hi> muſt be the Chriſt, and that hee is already come, but that hee ſhall not bee manifeſted till the time come that they ſhall be reſtored to their owne land againe, which though it bee true in a ſort, as I ſhewed <hi>Reaſon</hi> 5. yet to us it is ſufficient to marke the circumſtances of the text, and thereby to remove all ſcruple and doubt. Firſt the word <hi>Shiloh</hi> is interpreted, Her Sonne, becauſe hee was to be the Sonne of a virgin without the company of any man. Then the other circumſtance to whom the gathering or obedience of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple both Iewes and Gentiles ſhould be, cannot agree to any of the aforeſaid per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. For before the daies of <hi>Saul,</hi> Iudah had no governement more than any other tribe, and having never had any preeminence, it could not be ſaid to Iooſe it by <hi>Sauls</hi> being preferred to the kingdome. And although <hi>Ieroboam</hi> tooke tenne tribes from the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> yet the kingdome of <hi>Iuda</hi> did ſtill continue a Kingdome. And although <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> ruled over many people, yet he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued them by force, they gathered not unto him, as the word here ſignifieth, a willing obedience, and is therefore by <hi>Ierom</hi> tranſlated, expectation, or wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for: So that none of theſe could bee that <hi>Shiloh.</hi> Therefore their wiſeſt doctors, and both their paraphraſts tranſlate it, untill Meſſiah, or Chriſt come, the text is ſo plaine. But yet it may bee here queſtioned, how this Scepter or dominion continued in Iuda in the time of the captivity in <hi>Babylon;</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the time of the <hi>Machabees</hi> who were Prieſts of <hi>Levi,</hi> and yet ruled as Kings ſomewhat more than 160. yeares before Chriſt came. For certaine it is, that after <hi>Ianna Hircanus</hi> the grandfather of <hi>Levi,</hi> who was the great grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the bleſſed Virgin, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.24. none of the Stocke of <hi>David</hi> bare any rule as Prince, but the tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> ſwayed all, untill the time of <hi>Herod</hi> the great. To this it is anſwered, that by the marriages of the Prieſts with the tribe of Iuda and the family of <hi>David,</hi> as it is manifeſt in <hi>Iehoiada,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 11. and others, the rule might be ſaid to remaine in Iuda. But deſcents in Iſrael, were accounted by the male-ſide onely, who is therefore called <hi>Zacar</hi> of a word that ſignifies to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. And therefore in our Lords deſcent, though <hi>Tamar, Rahab,</hi> and <hi>Ruth</hi> are remembred for our comfort of the Gentiles; and to ſhew the conſtancy of Gods promiſe, His whole genealogie by his mother is reckoned up by S <hi>Luke</hi> in the ſeventy ſeventh generation: yet is the account by <hi>Ioſeph</hi> his ſuppoſed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther called the Sonne of <hi>Heli,</hi> though hee were onely his Sonne in Law. And therefore the Rabbins affirme that in the time of the captivity the great coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of the ſeventy elders inſtituted by God, <hi>numb.</hi> 11.25. did ever continue. And certaine it is, that the prince of the houſe of Iuda, <hi>Zorobabel</hi> of the line of <hi>David,</hi> was he under whom they did returne from captivity. But yet that either the one or the other had any authority or rule over their fellow captives in a forraine countrie, ſtauds not with any practice or policie now in uſe; no nor after their returne from thence, as it appeares, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.37. And although <hi>Daniel</hi> were a chiefe Prince in the Court, yet he procured the buſineſſe of the king onely, as Lord Treaſurer, <hi>Dan. cap.</hi> 6.2. or Chancellour, <hi>Dan. cap.</hi> 2.48.49. as <hi>Nehemiah</hi>
                              <pb n="157" facs="tcp:107656:94"/>and <hi>Mordecai</hi> by extraordinary fauour only procured the wealth of their people without any authority over them, but by ſpeciall commiſſion.

And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though M. <hi>Lively Perſ. mon. pag.</hi> 188. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to 193. have ſufficiently refuted this fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of moone-yeres; yet while hee ſticks ſo cloſe to the mudwall of theſe heathen ſtories, he is compelled to make this Meſſiah the Prince, to be another thing than that Holy of holies annointed. <hi>v.</hi> 24. <hi>Perſ. mon. p.</hi> 175. <hi>&amp;</hi> 200. and ſo for a full end of the controverſie turnes this propheſie quite from Chriſt; becauſe hee cannot ſee how it can ſtand with the juſt Chronology of the times, as indeed by his account it cannot. For whereas it is manifeſt by <hi>Ezr.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 8. &amp;c. that the foundation of the houſe of the Lord was laid in the 2. yeere after their return from <hi>Babylon,</hi> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> which he makes to be in the 2. yeere of the 55. olympiad, and was finiſhed in the ſixt of <hi>Darius, Ez.</hi> 6.15. with him <hi>Darius Nothus,</hi> in the ſecond of the 90. olympiad, and yet were not the gates of the palace ſet up til the 20. of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes,</hi> of him ſurnamed <hi>Memor,</hi> in the fourth yeere of the 98. olympiad, the Iewes muſt bee very ignorant of their owne ſtory, who ſaid, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.20. Six and forty yeares was this Temple a building, who by his account ſhould have
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:107656:95"/>ſaid 140. or rather 174. yeares: by which reckoning alſo <hi>Zorobabel</hi> muſt be 150. or rather 199. yeares old, when the building of the Temple went forward by the helpe of the prophets <hi>Haggai</hi> and <hi>Zach.</hi> though he were but 15 yeers old when he brought the people out of <hi>Babylon, ſee Zach.</hi> 4.9. So with him Chriſt is made to ſuffer in the fift yeere of the 65. weekes directly contrary to the grammar ſence of the 24 verſe: and the 70 weeks of <hi>Daniel</hi> are ended, by his reckoning, not in any remarkable event; but in the 37 yeere after Chriſts paſſion, three yeeres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and the Temple were deſtroyed. Let them limp that liſt with their <hi>Olympians,</hi> let them ſtumble and fall that ſo blend their profane learning with the holy Scripture, as that they make it voide of that which is the chiefe end thereof, that is the manifeſtation of Chriſt in the fulneſſe of time, according to the promiſes. But ſee this goodly reckoning by the <hi>Olympiads,</hi> and how ſure it is. <hi>Eraſm. Schmide proleg. in Pind.</hi> puts the firſt author of them <hi>Hercules</hi> the <hi>Idxan,</hi> one of the five <hi>Corybantes,</hi> that going from <hi>Crete</hi> to <hi>Elis,</hi> did there ſet up theſe games in the honour of <hi>Iupiter</hi> hisnurſling; which was not likely to be leſſe than a thouſand yeares before <hi>Iphitus,</hi> ſeeing his father <hi>Saturne</hi> was the Sonne of him who firſt brought inhabitants thither after the floud: after which <hi>Hercules</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intermitted, they were againe ſet up by <hi>Jupiter</hi> himſelfe, for his conqueſt over the <hi>Titans.</hi> But what meant theſe <hi>Cretians</hi> to appoint their triumphs in <hi>Peloponneſus?</hi> After <hi>Iupiter</hi> ſix renewers of theſe gamebales are accounted before <hi>Hercules</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Amphitruo,</hi> and after him, and <hi>Oxylus,</hi> and 400 yeeres in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion, they were againe ſet up by <hi>Iphitus</hi> the King of <hi>Elis,</hi> and a ſolemne <hi>Mart</hi> or Fare for all ſtrangers appointed, and the <hi>Olympiads</hi> changed from the fifth to every fourth yeere. And after this (forſooth) all accounts were exactly kept. Came ſuch perfection ſo on the ſuddaine? But if it were ſo exact for ever after, as that wee muſt examine the times of the Scripture thereby; how is it, that the moſt eminent city of the world knowes not her originall better? which ſome put in the firſt yeere of the ſixth <hi>Olympiad,</hi> other in the laſt; M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Livelie</hi> in the firſt of the ſeventh, but M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lydiat</hi> from <hi>Fabius Pict. Varro,</hi> and others proves the firſt foundation of <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Romulus</hi> to have been in the firſt of the eighth <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympiad.</hi> Now if a man ſhould aske whether the <hi>Graecian</hi> account by the <hi>Olympi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ads,</hi> or the <hi>Romane, ab urbe condita,</hi> were the ſurer; I thinke no man that hath heard, <hi>O vos Graeci ſemper pueri eſtis,</hi> but would take the latter: for as the recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by the <hi>Olympiads</hi> was vncertaine, ſo was it in no uſe till a little before the beginning of the <hi>Greeke</hi> Empire, <hi>Lydy.

Nay, ſuch baſe or rather no account was there of this leaden ruler of the <hi>Olympiads,</hi> that the author that deſcribed almoſt all the rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>konings uſed among the <hi>Greekes</hi> from <hi>Caecrops,</hi> about 700 yeares before <hi>Iphitus,</hi> and his <hi>Olympicks,</hi> though he remember <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and <hi>Croeſus,</hi> and <hi>Marathon,</hi> and the yron myne found in <hi>Crete,</hi> and the coinage of money in <hi>Aegina,</hi> and forgets not any wake, or horſe-race, or poet, or fidler of note, and continues his account to <hi>Seleucus Callinicus,</hi> within 180 yeeres of the uttermoſt end of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Monarchie, above 530 yeeres after theſe <hi>Olympiads,</hi> though hee were a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour thereto, and takes the <hi>Iſthmians</hi> in his way, yet is there in him not one word of this goodly reckoning, that now is growne ſo bold, and dares to lye ſo loud, as to ſilence the voice of the holy Scripture, <hi>See Marm.

                           <p>A ſecond argument for the preciſeneſſe of <hi>Daniels</hi> account, is from the forme of the words, <hi>Seventie weekes is cut out,</hi> a word plurall is joyned with a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; ſhewing an agreement of the whole in every part thereof.</p>
                           <p>A third argument may bee from the obſervation of the time of the evening ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice (for here is no word emptie or in vaine) which as it was anſwerable to the time of <hi>Adams</hi> fall, to the inſtitution of the Paſſeover; ſo ſhould Chriſt by that offering of himſelfe once, make ſatisfaction for the one, and finiſh the other, that the lifting up of his hands on the Croſſe might bee as the perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all evening ſacrifice, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.46. From whence I gather, that from the laſt day of the ſeventie yeeres captivity, the firſt of the going forth of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement from <hi>Cyrus,</hi> from the evening of that ſame day, theſe weekes were to receive their uttermoſt date, in the ſuffering of Chriſt, that the truth of the promiſe of God might bee according to all his workes, in number, weight, and meaſure, as it is ſaid, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.41. <hi>and</hi> 51.

                           </p>
                           <p>Fourthly, and if this time of our Lord had not beene thus defined and certaine by this prophecie, for the time of his ſuffering, upon what ground did our Lord preach, <hi>Marke</hi> 1, 15. <hi>The time is fulfilled, and the kingdome of heaven is at hand.</hi> Upon what ground could Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. <hi>But when the fulneſſe of the time was come, God ſent forth his Sonne?</hi> If there were no time in all the Scripture limited which was to bee fulfilled? and if there be any other fixed for the death of Chriſt, let it appeare; how alſo was his reprehenſion of the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Scribes and Sadduces juſt, that they could not diſcerne the times of the Sonne of man? <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.3. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.56. But by this account, from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> they might preciſely know the time of his ſuffering, as <hi>Rabbi Nehumiah</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Hacana</hi> ſaid, that hee wanted but fiftie yeeres, to the dayes of <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> as <hi>Galatinus</hi> writes out of the <hi>Talmud lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. So <hi>Symeon,</hi> ſirnamed the <hi>Iuſt,</hi> underſtanding the text of <hi>Daniel</hi> aright, for his hopes ſake found that favour from God, that he ſhould not ſee death till he had ſeene the Lord, <hi>Luke.</hi> 2.26.</p>
                           <p>I, but <hi>Nehemiah</hi> had commiſſion to build the wall of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> in the twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth yeere of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Darius Longhand, Nehem.</hi> 2. And it is plaine by the words of the Angell, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.25. that the account of the ſeventy weekes muſt begin from the commiſſion to build the wall, and ſo forraine hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories will accord with the Angell: a ſhrewd blocke whereat many have ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; but the building of the wall, is no limit of the time, but a thing to bee
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:107656:97"/>done in thoſe troublous times, <hi>ver.</hi> 25.

Chronol. Cap.</hi> 19. thinkes that here is obſcuritie ſought out of purpoſe; and that <hi>Daniel</hi> was ſtill ignorant of the time. I ſay that this anſwer is cleane contrarie to the profeſſion of the Angell in the 22. <hi>&amp;</hi> 23. <hi>v.</hi> Was his comming to give him skill and underſtanding, and would hee blinde him in obſcuritie, binde his underſtanding unto falſhood, by giving him one number for another? he durſt not doe it, it was againſt his nature; neither dare I beleeve the Ieſuite. Beſide, where <hi>Daniel</hi> is ignorant, he profeſſes it, as <hi>chap.</hi> 12.8. but here is not a word to that purpoſe. But I anſwer, that the ſtrength of this objection depends onely upon the ill interpretation of the text: for the words in 25. <hi>verſe From the going forth of the Commandement to reſtore and build againe Ieruſalem,</hi> as the old Latin hath it, <hi>Vt iterum aedificetur Ieruſalem,</hi> that <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> may be built againe, were in our former bibles (much better) <hi>to bring againe</hi> as <hi>Montanus, ad faciendum reverti,</hi> to cauſe the people to returne: for the word <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap> to returne in the neuter ſignification, in the conjugation here uſed is active, <hi>to make to returne.</hi> Now who were to bee made to returne, but they that had gone from thence? But take it at the hardeſt, <hi>to reſtore and to build, or to build againe,</hi> ſhould not they build, that ſhould enioy it and dwell there? ſo that of force theſe words muſt have reference to that word from <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> who gave the libertie to the people to returne and to build their Temple and the citie. And all the commiſſions in the favour of the Iewes which were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Cyrus,</hi> were onely to ſtrengthen and make good that firſt grant of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as it is manifeſt <hi>Ezech.</hi> 6. <hi>and</hi> 7. <hi>and Nehem.</hi> 2.8.

But eſpecially <hi>Ezra</hi> obſerveth preciſely the difference betweene <hi>Darius</hi> under whom the Temple was finiſhed, and <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> in whoſe ſeventh yeere he came to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> with a certaine <hi>Caravan</hi> of the Iewes, about 1600 <hi>Ezech.</hi> 7. And in the twentieth yeere of the ſame <hi>Artaxerxes, Nehemiah</hi> had a further comiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to build the wals, and brought none of the captivity with him, but was compelled to deſire a Convoy of the King; neither did hee build any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the walls: for as for timber for any houſes, hee had not a ſticke, onely by ſpeciall grace hee had out of the kings Parke timber for the gates of the citie, for his owne houſe, and for the gates of the palace or court of the Temple. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem.</hi> 2.7, 8. And from the foundation to this time were fortie ſixe yeeres <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.20. fully complete, though the body of the houſe had beene finiſhed foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene yeeres before, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 6.15.</p>

                           <p>Therefore I ſay, firſt, that ſeeing the Temple was already finiſhed, and the citie wanted not houſes, but inhabitants, <hi>Nehe.</hi> 11.1.2. it may appeare eaſilie how far this one act of building the wall was from that which was ſpoken of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> both by <hi>Eſay</hi> and the Angell. Secondly, and becauſe the <hi>Iewes</hi> were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy returned from <hi>Babylon,</hi> and that none returned with <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> And thirdly becauſe the wall was the laſt thing performed in the end of theſe troublous times of the firſt ſeven <hi>Sevennits,</hi> or 49 yeeres of which the Angell ſpake, it is impoſſible, and contrary to the very record of the holy Scripture, that theſe foure hundred ninety yeeres ſhould take their beginning in the twentieth of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> or at any time either after or before, but onely at that time when <hi>Zorobabel</hi> fanned <hi>Babel,</hi> and brought out the people thence.

Now what this ſecond Temple built by a ſmall band of poore captives in all but fortie two thouſand three hundred ſixtie, beſide their ſervants a wretched number of ſeven thouſand three hundred thirtie ſeven, and that in a deſolate countrey, amidſt ſo many enemies that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred their building, was like to bee in compariſon of <hi>Salomons,</hi> every man may eaſily conjecture.

By the moving of the Sea, hee meanes the miracle ſpoken of, <hi>Mar.</hi> 4.35. and <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.16. to 22. when by his word our Lord commanded the winds and ſeas, and they obeyed him. And if this interpretation had reſted with <hi>Ficinus</hi> by profeſſion a Phyſician, by ſect a <hi>Platonick,</hi> I had ſaid nothing; but ſeeing other profeſt Divines, and they not of the leaſt account, doe follow him herein, as <hi>Crocius</hi> aforeſaid, I thought it fit to cleare this text rather by that interpretation which the Apoſtle makes hereof, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.26, 27. which is directly to this purpoſe for which I cite it, where by the ſhaking is ſignified the removing of thoſe things that are ſhaken, that they which are not ſhaken may remaine. Now the whole drift of that Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle is to prove that the Law had but the ſhadowes of things to come, but the body was Chriſt. Therefore by the heaven underſtand the Eccleſiaſticall eſtate of the Iewes as it was ordered under the Law, and at Chriſts ſuffering utterly finiſhed: for the Law made nothing perfect, but was onely the bringing in of a better hope, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.19. <hi>and Chap</hi> 8. <hi>all.</hi> By the earth underſtand the civill po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, which was likewiſe ſo ſhaken by the Romans, that they had not power to put any man to death, <hi>Iohn</hi> 18.31. And after by <hi>Adrian</hi> were they utterly ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered from being a people. Theſe things then being thus ſhaken, and by the ſhaking removed; the ſacrifice of Chriſt and his kingdome muſt remaine, that he may be yeſterday, and to day, and the ſame for ever, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.8. that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law, and under the Law, and after the Law; the onely Mediatour betweene God and man. And as it was with the Iewes, ſo likewiſe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the Iſlands of the Sea, and of the maine land, were to bee ſhaken, that they might forſake their ſervice of dumbe idoles, to ſerve the living God, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.15. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.2. that ſo our Lord might bee the deſire and joy of all nations, and the Scripture fulfilled, which ſaith, <hi>Rejoyce thou barren that beareſt not, breake forth in joy thou that travelleſt not; for the deſolate Church of the Gentiles, hath many moe children than ſhee,</hi> the Synagogue of the Iewes <hi>that had the husband.

And as the Levites though di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed, yet for their zeale in avenging the idolatrie of the Iſraelites, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.26.7, 8. had this honour from God, to teach <hi>Jacob</hi> his judgements, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.9, 10 ſo the <hi>Simeonites</hi> likewiſe tooke this honour to themſelves to be teachers of the law in the Synagogues of <hi>Iacob,</hi> as the Levites in the ſcholes of Iſrael, as the <hi>Thar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum</hi> of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> hath recorded, and by theſe was that fulfilled which <hi>Iacob</hi> here propheſies concerning the man of men ſlaine by them, and that oxe the great ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for the ſin of the whole world, ſinew-cut or deprived of all ſtrength or life as concerning his fleſh, which fact of theirs the Patriarch doth ſo deteſt, as that neither his tongue nor thought ſhould give conſent thereto. For although the ignorant multitude thought that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould come in worldly glory; yet the Prophets knew that his kingdome was ſpirituall, and that by his death they were to be freed from death, and him that had the power of death, to whom they were ſubject becauſe of ſin. And therefore was it that <hi>Davids</hi> heart ſmote him when he had cut off the lap of Sauls garment (for <hi>Saul</hi> was a figure of <hi>Chriſt</hi>) leſt by that fact he were likewiſe a paterne of them, and ſo in ſome ſort parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker with them of whom he propheſied, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.18. <hi>They parted my garments among them.</hi> But you ſay the Scripture is not to bee ſtrained, for by that meanes everie thing may be made of any thing: but there is one onely ſence of the Scripture, and that according to the letter. I <hi>Anſwer:</hi> Our Lord ſaith, That <hi>Moſes</hi> writ of him. Can you ſhew it by the letter? hee ſaid
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:107656:99"/>indeed, <hi>A Prophet ſhall the Lord raiſe up unto you from among your brethren like unto mee, him ſhall ye heare.</hi> So he raiſed up <hi>David, Salomon, Eſay</hi> and the reſt, and they did heare and beleeve them; but him whom the Fat her ſent they beleeved not, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.38. Therefore this was not hee of whom <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote. Is this your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall underſtanding? He ſaith alſo, that <hi>Ionas</hi> was a ſigne of his buriall, and yet there is not a letter of it in all the booke of <hi>Ionas. Adam</hi> ſaid, <hi>This is now bone of my bone, and fleſh of my fleſh, and therefore ſhall a man leave his father and mother, and ſhall bee joyned to his wife.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> from hence <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.32. <hi>and Heb.</hi> 2.14. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes that ſeeing the children were partakers of fleſh and blood; therefore the Mediator alſo muſt be incarnate. But hee could not prove it by the letter, and therefore hee calls it a great myſterie. So then there is a myſticall ſence of the Scripture, as well as a literall. And the myſticall is rather to bee taken in this place; becauſe the Patriarch himſelfe in the firſt verſe of this Chapter, promiſes to tell them what ſhall befall them in the laſt dayes. Now it is manifeſt, that of the three eſtates of the Church: Firſt, under the law of nature: Secondly, of the ceremonies: thirdly, and of grace; that of grace onely could bee called the laſt dayes. For the eſtate of the Church under the law of nature was the firſt, and not utterly finiſhed, till the tables made of the unknowne matier were broken, <hi>Ex.</hi> 32.16.19. and then began the law of the ceremonies when the ſame words were againe written in the tables of ſtone which <hi>Moſes</hi> hewed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.1. which middle eſtate alſo laſted untill the Goſpell of repentance was preached by <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and was utterlie finiſhed in the <hi>Conſummatum eſt, Iohn</hi> 19.30. and then began this laſt eſtate of grace, called the laſt dayes, as it is manifeſt, <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.28. compared with <hi>Acts</hi> 2.17. and <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.1. and 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.18. So that this prophecie of <hi>Iacob,</hi> though it were in ſome ſort fulfilled as concerning their diſperſion in the ſecond ſtate of the Church, as I ſhewed; yet the uttermoſt accompliſhment of their foule offence in ſlaying that man, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured by their crueltie toward the <hi>Sychemites,</hi> could not bee till the laſt dayes when Chriſt was manifeſt in the fleſh. Compare herewith (if you will) <hi>Iacobi Brocardi Myſt. cap</hi> 1.49. and <hi>note (b) on Chapter</hi> 13. <hi>number</hi> 7.

And what allegoricall, myſticall, or anagogicall ſence ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is brought in beſide this rule, the rule of our holy faith, is as eaſily thruſt out, as it is brought in.

                              <hi>Troubled with all kinde of hereſies</hi>] The hereſies or errors abont this truth of our Lord Chriſt incarnate are in briefe of three kindes. The firſt, concerning the perſon, who was this Chriſt: the ſecond concerning His nature and being: the third concerning the attributes or proprieties of his being. The moſt anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:107656:99"/>hereſie concerning the perſon of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was that of the <hi>Herodians,</hi> of whom you reade in the Goſpell, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.16. <hi>Marke</hi> 3.6. Theſe, as <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> remembers <hi>Panarii lib.</hi> 1. held that <hi>Herod</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Antipater</hi> the <hi>Idumean</hi> was the true Chriſt promiſed to the Fathers, becauſe the ſcepter did utterlie ceaſe from <hi>Iuda</hi> in his time: but the gathering of the nations was not to <hi>Herod,</hi> as <hi>Iacob</hi> propheſied, ſo their hereſie vaniſhed. Hitherto you may bring all thoſe falſe gloſſes of the Iewes who turne the prophecies fulfilled in Chriſt, to other perſons, as to <hi>Ezechiah,</hi> to <hi>Zorobabel,</hi> to <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> to <hi>Iehoſhua,</hi> and to others, as they thinke fitteſt to mocke of the holy oracles from the true <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah,</hi> as you may reade in <hi>Pet. Galat. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 17. and in the note <hi>(b)</hi> above.

But the lewdneſſe and follie of other ſucceeding hereticks did equall this of the Iewes. And firſt that of <hi>Simon</hi> the Witch, who gave out himſelfe to bee the Chriſt, which though <hi>Auguſtine</hi> affirme in ſo many words; yet <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> have onelie ſo much in effect, that hee was that virtue and great power of God as you reade, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.10. How great then was his ſchollar <hi>Menander?</hi> who to all the falſhood of his Maſter added this, that hee was greater than <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Epiphanius in Pan.</hi> The hereticks called the <hi>Sethians,</hi> held that Chriſt which was borne of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> was no other then <hi>Seth,</hi> named <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. the ſonne of <hi>Adam.</hi> The <hi>Ophites</hi> held that the Serpent which deceived <hi>Eve,</hi> was Chriſt, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith: but neither <hi>Irenaeus, Tertullian,</hi> nor <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> affirme it. But <hi>Auguſtines</hi> authoritie alone is ſufficient to make us thinke that the <hi>Maniches</hi> held that the Serpent which taught <hi>Eve</hi> knowledge, and came in the laſt dayes to ſave the ſoules of men, muſt needs bee Chriſt. But theſe ſotteries were ſo ſenceleſſe, as that they neither laſted long, nor ſpread farre. But the enemie of mankinde would not ſuffer the fountaine of life, the ſincere doctrine of Chriſt to bee untroubled, and therefore beſide theſe hereſies concerning the perſon, who was that Chriſt promiſed to the Fathers, hee brought into this faith, which wee hold concerning Chriſt the ſonne of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> ſuch confuſion of opinions concerning his nature and properties (for his offices are in queſtion now) that <hi>Mahumed, Alcoran Cap.</hi> 20. rejoyced in himſelfe that hee was delivered from the opinions of the Chriſtians, ſo monſtrous in themſelves, ſo contrarie one to another, that the verie enemies of theſe hereſies were in confuſion thereabout, and as here and there contrary one to another, ſo ſometime to themſelves. You may reade if you will, the ſtories of the hereticks in the Fathers, <hi>Irenaeus, Epiphanius, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret, Iſidore, Euſebius, Ruffinus,</hi> and other hiſtorians of the Church, and in briefe, he that gathered from them all, the commentator on <hi>Aug. de haer.</hi> I, for avoiding of confuſion, will remember as occaſion is, the hereſies under the name or names of the moſt famouſed authors or defenders therof, and that without reſpect either of the time wherein they lived, or other opinions which they held beſide: for I write not the hiſtorie of the wars, but the triumph onely of the Chriſtian faith.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. The <hi>Monophyſitae</hi> or hereticks which held but one onely nature in Chriſt, were of divers families: for <hi>Eutiches,</hi> while hee went about to refute <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> who held as two natures, ſo two perſons in Chriſt, confeſſed that Chriſt was of two natures God and man before the uniting of them both; but after the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:107656:100"/>union of them, they became as one perſon, ſo one nature: becauſe the manly being was utterlie ſwallowed up of the Divine, and changed thereinto, as a drop of vineger in the Sea doth utterly looſe both the taſte and being of vineger. This the <hi>Armenians</hi> and <hi>Iacobites</hi> heretofore have held, but now they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the true faith.

                           <p n="4">4. But on the other ſide, <hi>Ebion, Carpocrates</hi> and <hi>Theodotion</hi> affirmed that Chriſt was pure and onely man, begotten by <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of his wife <hi>Mary,</hi> as other children, and that God was in him, as in <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> or any other man, and by a greater progreſſe in virtue, hee came to be more righteous than other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he received a more noble ſoule than other men, by which he knew and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veiled heavenly truths, and by an aſſiſting power of God, he wrought miracles, as <hi>Moſes</hi> or other of the Prophets had done before. This herefie the <hi>Socinians,</hi> as <hi>Wentz. à Budowecks</hi> doth charge them, have renewed of late; yet after by him it ſeemes, they are come to yeeld unto Chriſt as much as <hi>Arius.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="5">5. <hi>Artemou, Theodotus of Byzant.</hi> or <hi>Conſtantinople, Paulus</hi> of <hi>Samoſata,</hi> and <hi>Photinus</hi> held that Chriſt had no being before hee tooke beginning of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo was onely man by nature, but that God, which <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds the <hi>Word,</hi> deſcended into him: which error <hi>Athanaſius Epiſtola de in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnat. contra Paulum Samoſat.</hi> holds to be all one with that of <hi>Carpocrates.</hi>

                           <p n="6">6. <hi>Cerinthus</hi> to that progreſſe in virtue of <hi>Ebion</hi> and <hi>Carpocrates,</hi> added this, That Chriſt, which hee interpreted the holy Ghoſt, deſcended into Ieſus the ſon of <hi>Mary,</hi> when he was baptiſed in <hi>Iordan,</hi> and made knowne unto him the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whom hee knew not before; and hence it came to paſſe that Ieſus after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward did ſuch great miracles, becauſe Chriſt was in him. Thus of one hee made two Mediators, one Ieſus wherein Chriſt was, and another Ieſus without Chriſt: for hee added that Ieſus ſuffered and died, but that Chriſt without any ſuffering flew backe to heaven; as <hi>Colarbaſus</hi> alſo after him did teach. This <hi>Cerinthus</hi> is that hereticke as ſaith <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> that troubled the Church in the Apoſtles time, affirming that the Gentiles ought to bee circumciſed, and keepe the Law, which hereſie of his the Councell of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> determined, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. The hereticks called <hi>Alogiani,</hi> becauſe they denied Chriſt to bee God the <hi>Word,</hi> hold in effect as much as the former concerning his nature, but yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not, but that for his great grace and virtue he was made the Mediator for other men. But the writings of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> they vtterlie denie; becauſe, ſay they, the other Evangeliſts doe no where call Chriſt the <hi>Word. Anſwer.</hi> But they call him, and prove him to bee God, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 1 23. <hi>God with us,</hi> from whence is the gift of pophecie, and power to caſt out devils, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.22. ſo <hi>Marke</hi> 1.24. The devils confeſſe his power, and him to be the Holy one of God. And <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.34.35.
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:107656:100"/>The Angel profeſſes that holy thing which was to bee borne of the Virgin, to be the Sonne of God. All his glorious miracles prove as much, which were neither wrought by the power of <hi>Baalzebub,</hi> as the old Iewes, nor yet by magicke, or by the meanes of the <hi>Cabala,</hi> as the later Iewes affirmed, but onely by the power of God, as our Lordhimſelfe proves by an unanſwerable argument, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. to 23.</p>
                           <p>And theſe are the moſt famouſed hereſies of them who held but one nature in Chriſt; divine as <hi>Eutyches,</hi> who changed the humane nature into the divine: or humane; as <hi>Apollinarius,</hi> who thought the divine nature was changed into the humane: or one mixt nature of both theſe, as the <hi>Timotheans</hi> beleeved: or purely humane, as <hi>Ebion, Cerinthus, Photinus</hi> and the <hi>Alogians:</hi> wherein it will not be unfit that we briefly conſider their reaſons, and ſee what anſwers are, or may be made thereto.</p>
                           <p>§. 1. And firſt concerning the hereſie of <hi>Eutyches,</hi> you may by this ſee how dangerous it is. For if it be put, that after the union of both natures, the humane nature was utterly ſwallowed up of the divine; ſo that the divine nature onely remayned, then it muſt follow of neceſſity, either that we are ſtill in the ſtate of damnation, or that God muſt ſuffer and dye for us, in the divine nature: which as it is impoſſible; ſo yet ſhould wee be ſtill in the ſtate of condemnation. For if our redemption bee not wrought for us in our owne nature, the divine Iuſtice is ſtill unſatisfied: ſo wee are ſtill in our ſinne. And therefore the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> held by ſix hundred and thirty Fathers to condemne theſe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of his, viz. that the natures were apart before the union, as if the humanity had had any being before it was taken to the Godhead; or that the beings in themſelves, or their proprieties were either confuſed, or changed, confeſſed him, <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap>. that is, one and the ſame Sonne in the two natures (but remember the word <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

But ſome of the later <hi>Eutichians</hi> minced the mattier, and ſaid, that unity of nature was not till after His reſurrection. But that, both againſt the authority of the Scripture, and reaſon it ſelfe. For Hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived power of the Father to raiſe the dead, to give eternall life, to execute the Iudgement as he is the Sonne of man, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 25.26.27. all theſe things not yet performed. And how can the heavens containe Him, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.21. if hee bee onely God, whom the heaven, and the heaven of heavens cannot containe? <hi>Kings</hi> 8 27. or what hope can wee have of being made like unto Him, if Hee bee onely God? yet have we aſſurance, that as we have borne the image of the earthly; ſo ſhall wee alſo beare the image of the heavenly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.49. The words of our Lord himſelfe are yet more cleare, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.39. <hi>Handle me and ſee me: for a Spirit hath not fleſh and bones; as yee ſee me have.</hi> The truth of his bodily being after his reſurrection is there argued by his eating and many other infallible proofes, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of 40. dayes <hi>Act.</hi> 1.3. And in the laſt two chapters of Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Goſpell all to this purpoſe, that wee may beleeve that he that deſcended into the grave, is even the ſame that aſcended in the perfection of His manly being to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare for us before the Father, till the day of our redemption, when he ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent us unblameable in his ſight, as it is ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Behold me, and the children which thou haſt given me, ſee Ioh.</hi> 6.39.</p>
                           <p>But ſee the reaſon of this hereſie of <hi>Eutyches,</hi> delivered by that ſecond Synod of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> called <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, which murthered the vertuous and faithfull <hi>Flavian,</hi> and blaſted with their ſtinking curs all them that ſhould affirme that there were two natures in Chriſt, forſooth, becauſe hee is the onely Sonne of God, not two Sonnes, not two Perſons, but one Sonne, one Perſon, <hi>Euagrius Hiſt. Eccleſ lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 18. And yet our Lord ſaith of himſelfe, <hi>whom doe men ſay that I the Sonne
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:107656:101"/>of man am? Math.</hi> 16.3. And as often is hee called in the Scripture the Sonne of man, the Sonne of <hi>David,</hi> the Sonne of the virgin, of the carpenter, &amp;c. as the Sonne of God: and yet but one Sonne, and yet but one perſon of both natures divine and humane, as I ſhewed before in the beginning of the 23. chapter. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre you thither. But the anſwer of that wiſe Prince of the <hi>Sarazens Alamunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> was ſufficient to ſtop the croaking of thoſe foule birds of the <hi>Ephiſine</hi> cage of whom ſome comming to tainte him with that bane, he told them that he had received letters that <hi>Michael</hi> the Archangel was lately dead: when they anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that it was impoſſible that an Angel ſhould ſuffer either ſickneſſe or death, hee replyed: And if Chriſt have not two natures aſwell the manly as the divine, how could hee endure the paines and death of the Croſſe? For if an Angel can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not dye, much leſſe hee that is onely God, <hi>Theod. Collect. loc. cit.</hi> And this may be ſufficient for all the rable rout of <hi>Eutyches.</hi> But if you deſire more reaſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his opinion, you may finde them in <hi>Tho. Aq. cont. Gent. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 35. And although this hereſie be imputed unto <hi>Eutyches</hi> (as I have ſhewed) yet it is plaine that it was an hereſie before <hi>Eutyches</hi> was borne. For Saint <hi>Athanaſius</hi> in his ſixt Sermon hath moſt wittily and plainely refuted it.</p>
                           <p>§. 2. The hereſie of <hi>Apollinaris</hi> is as wide from the truth on the other ſide, and as it favours of the hereſie of the <hi>Theopaſchites</hi> (which you ſhall heare anon) ſo it favours that ſottery of the Manichees that made the Godhead diviſible into parts, as you have heard before, <hi>chap.</hi> 8. <hi>note</hi> 6. §. 3. or rather yet worſe than ſo, if any thing can be worſe than that which is worſt, or more falſe than that which is moſt falſe. 1. For if any part of God became man, then God in part of Himſelfe muſt ceaſe to be God, and God muſt ſuffer detriment or loſſe, when part of His being is either taken away or changed to the worſe. 2. So God alſo ſhould bee ſubject to compoſition and accidents, contrary to that which hath beene proved, <hi>chap.</hi> 9. <hi>numb.</hi> 3.5.6.] 3. Whereupon it would alſo follow, that ſeeing his being is moſt ſimple and pure, if any of his divine being were coeſſentiall to his huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, then alſo the whole. 4. And moreover it would follow that God were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther infinire, nor eternall. For whatſoever is changed into another ceaſes to be that which it was before. But this is contrarie to that which hath bin ſhewed <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. ſo then all theſe things are impoſſible. And therefore the Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes againſt this opinion, that God is eternally one and the ſame, as S. <hi>Iames</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſaith <hi>c.</hi> 1.17. that in Him there is neither variableneſſe, nor ſhadow of Change.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. But ſee their arguments. Firſt, <hi>The Word became fleſh, Ioh.</hi> 1.14. Therefore the <hi>Word</hi> was changed into fleſh, bones, ſinewes, haire, &amp;c. Anſwer. The word <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Againe a thing may bee ſaid to be, to become, or to bee made this or that ſubſtantially, as when the food is changed into the ſubſtance of that which is nouriſhed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by then it is made or become that which it doth nouriſh. But thus the Word could not become fleſh, but rather fleſh ſhould have bin made the Word. For in al manner of working to the change of one thing into another, the more noble and powerfull agent muſt have the preeminence. But this is neither affirmed in the Scripture, nor poſſible to be true.</p>
                           <pb n="171" facs="tcp:107656:101"/>
                           <p>Thirdly a thing may be ſaid to become or to be made this or that eſſentially, as every particular matier and forme under every ſpecies become, or are made one individuall; as the body and ſoule in <hi>Plato,</hi> eſſentially become the proper perſon which we call <hi>Plato.</hi> But thus the deity and humanity became not eſſentially one individuall, under any common ſpecies or kinde. For the deity came not to the humanity, as the forme thereof, which had the full and perfect proper forme, the humane ſoule and underſtanding. Moreover all formes are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined for their matiers, and all matiers have in them a naturall appetite to thoſe formes whereof they are capeable. But nothing of this was in that above-wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full generation. For neither could the humanity when it was not, de ſire that the deity ſhould dwell therein: neither was the deity ordained for any ſuch end, as to dwell in man: but of his owne onely holy will, and love to man, was he pleaſed ſo to bleſſe the creature.

For this is that wonder of wonders which paſſes the underſtanding of men and Angels to conceive, for which his wondrous conception by the Holy Ghoſt, his wonderfull birth of a virgin were, by which his glorious miracles, his wonderfull reſurrection, and aſcenſion, and the wonderfull happineſſe and eternity of his creature are wrought. And although as the two natures, ſo their proprieties are different in Him: ſo that wee may truely ſay of Him according to the ſeverall natures, that hee was dead, and yet could not dye, that Hee ſuffered, and yet could not ſuffer, or the like: yet muſt all theſe contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of neceſity bee underſtood of the diſtinct natures in the unity of that one Perſon indiſtinct; ſo that the difference bee in the natures, not in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And thus the Scripture hath taught us to ſpeake as it is ſaid, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.10. <hi>He was in the world, and the world was made by him:</hi> which clauſes though they may receive diſtinction by the differences of his being; yet in the unity of his Perſon, none at all. For the ſame Perſon hath made the world, and yet was in the world as another man. For to reſpect the Sonne according to the perfection of his deity, although nothing be eſſentiall unto him, but that hee bee eternally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of the ſubſtance of the Father: yet ſince he was pleaſed to take on him the office of our Mediator, it was neceſſary, that hee ſhould take alſo our being wherein alone the ſatisfaction for us ſhould be wrought. For as it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that our Mediator ſhould be God, that hee might be able to ſave and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the manhood induring that puniſhment which might ſatisfie the infinite Iuſtice, and raiſe it up againe to life; leſt being ſwallowed up of thoſe torments Hee ſhould not bee able to give life to them for whom Hee ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered (for the State of the members cannot bee better than of the head.) So was it neceſſarie that hee ſhould bee made fleſh, that is, become truly and eſſentially man, that the puniſhment being borne in the nature that had offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that nature might bee reſtored to the favour which it had loſt. Neceſſary, I ſay; but I meane not by any abſolute neceſſitie on the behalfe of God: for Hee is Debtor to no man, nor on him can any neceſſitie bee layd toward the creature without which he is infinite in glory and perfection; but yet neceſſarie with that neceſſity of ſuppoſition; that ſeeing God, for the praiſe of his Grace, would by Himſelfe reſtore His Creature that had ſinned, it was neceſſarie that hee ſhould take on him the nature and being of that creature; at leaſt in part, if He would reſtore it but in part: but becauſe the creature had ſinned in the whole; not in ſoule alone, nor in body alone, nor in the one without the other; it was neceſſarie that He ſhould become whole and entire man, not to take on Him the ſoule of man onely, but to become alſo fleſh, that he might redeeme both ſoule and body.</p>

                           <p>§. 3. Now concerning that confuſion or mingling of the two natures in Chriſt into one, which the <hi>Timotheans</hi> imagined: if neither the beings, nor the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties of the beings divine and humane bee changed: neither the <hi>Divine</hi> into the <hi>Humane,</hi> as <hi>Eutyches</hi> imagined, nor the divine into the humane, as <hi>Apollinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> ſuppoſed: it cannot bee inferred by any reaſon, that any ſuch confuſion is or ought to be yeelded unto. It is true which the <hi>Timotheans</hi> ſuppoſed, that if any ſuch mixture were, the thing that did ariſe from that mixture muſt needs bee a third thing differing from them both. For true mixture is the union of bodily parts changed by the mixture from their former being, ſo that neither the being, nor
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:107656:102"/>accidents of the things mingled is <hi>ſaved</hi> or kept entire in the mixture, but (at leaſt in part) corrupted, as in the mingling of wine and water, of blacke and white colour, neither the one nor the other remaine in their perfection. And to admit this mixture in the union of the divine and humane natures in Chriſt, as it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible in reſpect of the divine being, which hath not any bodily parts: So were it utterly to make void the comming of Chriſt, which upon this mixture ſhould have ſuffered in ſuch a third being as had never ſinned.</p>
                           <p>And if this foundation of the mixture of the two natures in Chriſt bee taken away, all the Cage-worke of the <hi>Theodoſians,</hi> that the Mediatour is mortall, and of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> that hee could not ſuffer, muſt needes bee rotten and unable to ſtand. Therefore let us conſent to that Antheme of the Church. <hi>Mirabile myſterium! Deus homo factus eſt, id quod erat permanſit: id quod non erat aſſumpſit: nec commixtionem paſſus neque confuſionem.</hi> O wonderfull my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie!

                           <p>§. 4. 5. 6. 7. Now it remaines to ſhew what were the holdfaſt of <hi>Ebion, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthus, Photinus,</hi> and the reſt of that ging. For you may perceive how that although they had their private differences in their opinions; yet like theeves, they all conſpired in this, to robbe the Lord of glory, of the Robe of His Divinity.</p>
                           <p>The reaſons of their opinions after the long and weariſome reading of the Fathers which recite and anſwer them ſometimes heavily and with much adoe, you ſhall finde moſt briefly laid downe by Saint <hi>Thomas, contra gent. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap</hi> 4.9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 28. which in effect ſtand only in the miſinterpreting of certaine texts of the holy Scripture. For the better underſtanding of which, let me remember you of theſe two rules. Firſt, to hold ſtedfaſtly that the termes or attributes which are given unto Chriſt in the Scripture concerning His divine being, belong unto him eſſentially and properly, whereas the ſame termes attributed to the Saints, belong unto them only by grace and appropriatly. And by this difference you ſhall anſwer their cavils when being urged with ſuch texts as this, <hi>Heb</hi> 1.5. <hi>Thou art my Sonne, this day have I begotten thee:</hi> they anſwer, <hi>the angels are alſo called the Sonnes of God, Iob.</hi> 1.6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2.1. <hi>and magiſtrates, Pſal.</hi> 82.6. <hi>yea all the Saints are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Sonnes of God, Phil.</hi> 2.15. <hi>and</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.1. and this is only by a grace appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate, and imparted unto us; whereas Chriſt is the Sonne of God according to his eſſence and true being, as it is ſaid, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.30. <hi>I and the Father are one,</hi> not <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap> one thing, one being, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> interprets it. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6. <hi>That he was in the forme of God:</hi> that is, in the moſt in ward or eſſentiall being, God (for he hath no matier) equall to God; <hi>that every tongue may confeſſe that Ieſus Chriſt is Iehova,</hi> for ſo the word is there to be underſtood, becauſe the Greekes every where in the old Teſtament interpret <hi>Iehovah</hi> by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap> the Lord. The ſecond rule is, that the proprieties of one nature in Chriſt, doe not deſtroy or denie the other nature, as where it is ſaid that He was hungrie, that he wept; that he ſlept, that He was ignorant of the Iudgement day, and of the grave of <hi>Lazarus;</hi> that his ſoule was heavie, &amp;c. which belonged properly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Him as man, and prove that hee was truly man, in bodie and ſoule; yet doe they not at all take away the being of his Godhead, but that with his manly being wee ought to confeſſe that hee is God bleſſed above all for ever and ever, Amen. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. And by this difference well obſerved you may give a true anſwer to thoſe texts which they falſly urge to their concluſion; as where it is ſaid, <hi>All power is given unto mee in heaven and in earth, Matth.</hi> 28.18. And againe, <hi>Philippians.</hi> 2.9. <hi>That God hath exalted him.</hi> So where Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.36. <hi>That God hath made the ſame Ieſus which was crucified, both</hi>
                              <pb n="174" facs="tcp:107656:103"/>Lord and Chriſt. By which texts and the like, they would conclude that hee is not God by nature, but for his merit and greater graces onely called God, as it was ſaid to <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Behold, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh.</hi> For, (ſay they) Hee that receives of another to be exalted, to bee made a Lord, is not ſuch of himſelfe. But this concluſion followes not, but rather that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> affirmes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. That Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, which was made of the ſeed of <hi>David</hi> according to the fleſh, was powerfully declared to be the Sonne of God by his reſurrection from the dead, when he in is humane beeing received all power: and was exalted above every name, and manifeſtly declared to be both Lord and Chriſt, both God and man. The power therfore and glory was in him, being God eſſentiall and eternall: and in him being made man, manifeſted by his reſurrection, to dwell in that manhood eternally. And as that which theſe heretikes clatter, is directly againſt the authority of the holy Scripture, ſo is it utterly againſt all ſenſe and reaſon: For if our Saviour were onely man, then our comfort which wee ſhould have by him, as being able to ſave, becauſe hee is God, were utterly deſtroyed; as a Father ſaith, I would not beleeve in him, if he were not God. And this according to the Word of God, <hi>Ier.</hi> 17.5. <hi>Curſed bee the man that truſteth in man.</hi> Moreover, if Chriſt were onely man, excelling o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers onely by his progreſſe in vertue; ſo that for his greater grace above others he might be made a Mediatour for others, then many mediatours might be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to bee, ſeeing <hi>Noah, Daniel, Ioh,</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> exceeded others in vertue, and by ſpeciall grace many others might exceed them; but ſo our Lord ſhould not be the onely Sonne, the onely Mediatour, contrary to that which the Scripture witneſſeth, as you heard in the end of the Chapter. <hi>n.</hi> 10. Therefore concerning the Mediatour, what he ought to bee, let the followers of <hi>Ebion</hi> and <hi>Photinus</hi> heare Saint <hi>Paul, Heb.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Seeing then that we have a great High Prieſt, that is paſſed into the heavens, Ioſus the Sonne of God, let us hold faſt our profeſſion.</hi> And againe, <hi>Verſe</hi> 15. let the Eutychian heare, and be aſhamed, for, <hi>Wee have not an High Prieſt which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without ſinne.</hi> Therfore Jeſus our Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour is both God and Man.

Aquin. contragent. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 38. cites <hi>Damaſcen</hi> to this purpoſe; We affirme, that there is a perfect union of the two natures, not according to the Perſon, as the enemy of God <hi>Neſterius</hi> affirmed, but alſo accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Hypoſtaſis. From whence <hi>Tho.</hi> concludes, that this was the poſition of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> to confeſſe one perſon in Chriſt, and two <hi>Hypoſtaſes.</hi> If by <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſes</hi> he meant the Divine and humane natures united in the one Perſon of our
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:107656:103"/>Mediator, neither <hi>Damaſcen,</hi> nor <hi>Thomas</hi> can blame him for it. But if by the manly Hypoſtaſis conſiſting of body and ſoule, he muſt meane a humane perſon, as <hi>Thomas</hi> in the ſame place out of <hi>Boetius,</hi> determines, you may ſee how they made a quarrell more than needed. For though <hi>Neſtorius</hi> had beene madd, yet would he never have held one Perſon of both natures, and alſo two perſons. But it is cleare by the later Hiſtorians of the Church, that this among other, was the hereſie of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> that as in Chriſt there were two natures, ſo there were alſo two perſons: which opinion might eaſily take the originall from <hi>Gerin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus, Photinus,</hi> and ſuch as ſtunk of that Pumpe. For if God the Word, came to dwell in <hi>Jeſus</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Mary,</hi> being a perfect humane perſon of body and ſoule, (whether at his Baptiſme, as <hi>Cerinthus</hi> taught, or from the very inſtant of his conception, as the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> of this time affirme, the poſition of <hi>Neſtorius</hi> muſt follow of neceſſitie, that there be in him, as two natures, ſo two perſons. For the God head deſtroyed nothing of the humane perfection which it found: So that if it came not to the humane nature, but in the ſubſiſtence of a manly perſon, then that humane nature muſt remaine in the perfection of a perſon, as it was before. Whence that followes alſo not unfitly, which hee further affirmed, that the things of infirmity which were in Chriſt, as to eate, to drinke, to ſleepe, to grow in wiſedome, &amp;c. belonged to the ſonne of <hi>Mary,</hi> without the Sonne of God; and all the glorious miracles which Chriſt did worke, were done by the Sonne of God, without the ſonne of <hi>Mary.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But the ſuppoſition of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> that the deitie came into the humanity, when the humanitie had perfect ſubſiſtence in ſoule and body, that is in the perfection of a perſonall beeing, is moſt falſe: For the Word taking fleſh of the Virgin, cau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed it to become one perſon with himſelfe; ſo that the body aſſumed was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and peculiar body of God, and the humane ſoule, the ſoule of God, not of any other Perſon, but the body and ſoule of the Sonne of God; and this not onely while the ſoule dwelt in the body, according to the naturall life, but alſo while he was yet under the burden of our ſinnes, his body in the grave, his ſoule in Hell, as the Apoſtle cites the Scripture, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.27. <hi>Thou wilt not leave my ſoule in Hell, neither wilt thou give thy Holy one to ſee corruption:</hi> So then the body in the grave was the Holy One of God, for nothing elſe of him was ſubject to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: and though it were for a time forſaken of the ſoule, yet not of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, which thing the words of the Angel doe confirme, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.6. <hi>Come ſee the place where the Lord lay:</hi> So that our Saviour on the Croſſe, yea, even in the bands of death (as concerning his body) was ſtill the Lord and God of glory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8. And if it be moſt true, that God is more inward, and more neare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to every thing, than can be expreſſed by any words of beeing, of effence, of nature, ſubſtance, moties, forme, proprietie, or the like: becauſe he is the foundation unto all theſe, and in him all things conſiſt: How much more ſhall hee bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and fundamentall unto that body, ſoule, and Spirit of Ieſus, which hee was pleaſed to make his own, that by that body and blood of his, he might redeeme his Church, as it is ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. That God purchaſed his Church with his owne blood, that is, with the life and blood of that body, which was proper and peculiar unto himſelfe. Thus then the word was made fleſh, not by any tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation or change of the one, or the other from their true and naturall being; but becauſe that by a ſecret and unſpeakable conjunction the Word was made one with the fleſh, and the fleſh with the Word. So then the Sonne of GOD tooke the humanitie, not that it might be another perſon beſide himſelfe; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in himſelfe perfect God, he would alſo in himſelfe be perfect man, taking fleſh of the Virgin. (The differences of union you may ſee (if you will) in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>N. Byfield Chap.</hi> 16.)</p>
                           <p>This union of the Godhead and Manhood, is manifeſt by divers Texts of the holy Scripture. For evidence of which we will firſt put this infallible axiome;
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:107656:104"/>That of two different perſons one cannot poſſibly bee affirmed of the other, as to ſay, that <hi>Peter,</hi> is <hi>Iohn,</hi> or <hi>Iohn</hi> is <hi>Peter</hi> neither yet that the proprieties of the one, can belong to the other, as to ſay that the Goſpell of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> is the Epiſtle of Saint <hi>Peter.</hi> Now it is ſaid <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.28. <hi>I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world,</hi> which belongs to Him, as to the Sonne of God, as <hi>Iohn</hi> expounds it, 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 4.9. and then it followes, <hi>Againe I leave the world and goe to the Father,</hi> which is peculiar to him as man, as it is ſaid, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.21. Therefore Ieſus the Sonne of God and the Sonne of the virgin is one and the ſame perſon, ſo <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16. that ſame He by whom all things were made v. 18. is the head of the Church, and the firſt borne from the dead; and <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. Hee who is of the Fathers concerning the fleſh, is God bleſſed above all. This our Lord affirmed of himſelfe, <hi>Math.</hi> 26.63.64. to be the Sonne of God, and the Son of man, and againe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.13. Hee that came downe from heaven is the Sonne of man, and againe <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.13.

That Chriſt by his eternall ſpirit offered himſelfe without ſpot unto God. But if the humanity of Chriſt be another perſon beſide the deity, then he offered not himſelfe, but that other perſon of the humanity by whoſe death our reconcilation was wrought, and ſo not by his owne bloud, but by the bloud of another perſon, ſhould hee have entred into the holy place.

And although this <hi>Hydra</hi> might ſeeme to have beene nipt in the head by the writings of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and other learned men of former times, and eſpecially
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:107656:104"/>by the firſt Councell of <hi>Nice Anno</hi> 327. and other that followed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; yet never was there any hereſie in the primitive Church, that went on with that violence and ſtrength, or that cauſed more trouble and perſecution, as being confirmed by divers Councels, and ſet forward by the authority of ſundry Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. And for the continuance thereof, it hath been ſuch, as that unto this day not onely among the Turkes, but ever in the Church of Chriſt (if at leaſt they may bee ſaid to bee of his Church, who falſly denie unto him the truth, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of his being) ſome have beene found from time to time even ſince the clearer light of the truth hath ſhined, that have maintained this hereſie of <hi>Arius</hi> in whole or in part, as <hi>Socinus, Gittichius, David the Hollander, Servetus Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerus,</hi> and with us, <hi>Legat, Mannering,</hi> and others.

                           <p>But (ſay you) is it poſſible that an hereſie ſo foule as this is taken to bee, ſhould continue ſo long, and be upheld by Councels, and maintained by Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, and juſtified by learned men, except there were both reaſon and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Scripture for it? For as no man is wilfully ill but by the errour of his judgement betweene good and bad; ſo no man doth erre wilfully, but onely by miſtaking of falſhood for the truth. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith that there muſt be hereſies, and this I ſuppoſe ſhould come to paſſe becauſe men would not be content to learne the doctrine of Chriſt and his truth according to the ſimplicity of the truth, as he had taught it in the holy Scriptures, whereunto if men would take heed, and trie the truth as they ought, the things of God by the word of God, matiers of Religion by the rule of Religion, that is, the holy Scripture alone, ſo many hereſies had not ſprung up. For mans underſtanding ſo long as it doth follow the true guide thereof, the revealed truth of God, it cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive nor be deceived. But if it will preſume to be guide and make the truth of the Scriptures to follow it, it is impoſſible not to ſtray; and ſo by the juſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God men alſo grow hard and obſtinate in their owne errours, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reſiſt the truth, but alſo to perſecute it, as theſe <hi>Arians</hi> did very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly at ſeverall times. But ſee their reaſons and their authorities.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. The Godhead is in the Father wholly, or elſe hee cannot bee perfect God; and if the Deitie be wholly in the Father, then can it not be in the Sonne, nor in the holy Ghoſt. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The word wholly is equivocall, or of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meaning: for wholly may ſignifie as much as with all the parts; but this cannot belong to that which is infinite, or wholly may ſignifie onely, and ſo the propoſition is falſe; or it may meane aſmuch as perfectly, and ſo the propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is true, but the conſequence is falſe: for the Deitie is wholly and perfectly in all the perſons alike.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. He onely is the true God, that is prayed unto by the Mediator: But God the Father onely is ſo prayed unto; therefore God the Father onely is the true God. I <hi>anſwer.</hi> If we worſhip the Godhead in the nature, or being of God, we worſhip one onely being in the three Perſons. But if we worſhip the perſons, we worſhip them in the vnitie of the Godhead, that is, acknowledging every perſon to be God. And this is that Father, that one God whom we pray unto by that one Mediator of God and man, the man Ieſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. who having himſelfe in his owne body borne our ſinnes upon the tree, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. is ſet at the right hand of God, and makes interceſſion for us <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. and hath commanded all them to come unto him that travaile and are heavie laden, that hee may refreſh them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. When the Sonne was begotten and the holy Ghoſt proceeded, either hee was, or he was not: If he were before he was begotten, then was he not begotten: if he were not, then there was a continuance when he was not: and therefore of neceſſitie he muſt be created. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Eternitie hath no reſpect of time, of before, or after, becauſe it is one continuall perpetuity, and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:107656:105"/>ever being or action is once therein, it is eternall. Therefore that difference of was and was not, hath no place in eternity, ſeeing the generation is eternall, ever one and the ſame, as you may ſee further in the treatiſe at the end of the booke.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Whatſoever is begotten, receives the nature which it hath from that which doth beget, as a man from man, fire from fire, and in all other univocall generations, in which though the natures be of one kinde, yet muſt they needs be different in number, as in <hi>Iſaak</hi> and <hi>Iacob.</hi> But this cannot be in the divine ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, for ſo there ſhould bee moe Gods than one, or if the nature of the Sonne bee in number the ſame with that of the Father, then doth the Sonne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that nature either in part, which is impoſſible, becauſe a moſt ſimple and pure being cannot be divided into parts; or entyer and whole; and ſo the Father ſhould ceaſe to be. Neither is the generation as of a river out of a fountaine, becauſe the Divine nature is neither diviſible, nor poſſible to be encreaſed. Therefore Ieſus is not the Sonne of God by generation, but by creation onely. <hi>Anſw.</hi> The being of God is not materiall, which only is ſubject to diviſion into parts, and that totality which is made of parts: but his being is intellectuall; and becauſe it is infinite, and apprehended by an infinite underſtanding, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie that the divine being or underſtanding be wholly in the word or being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. I meane with that totality of perfection which is in the unitie of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpoken of in the firſt objection.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Either the Father begat the Sonne with his will, or againſt his will; not againſt his will: for ſo it had beene impoſſible that ever hee ſhould have beene begotten; if with his will, then his will muſt be before, and ſo the Son cannot be eternall. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> rejects this reaſon, becauſe all the kindes of begetting are not reckoned up: for in God (ſaith hee) is no deliberation for the inclining of his will: therefore the Deitie is that nature according to which the Father did beget the Sonne, neither ever ceaſes to beget him eternally. But this is to beget the Sonne with his will, ſeeing the will of God is his being, according to which he workes eternally, as you may further underſtand <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. <hi>note (d)</hi>

                           <p>Many ſuch arguments as theſe are, and many bee brought to this purpoſe of <hi>Arius,</hi> all which, as theſe that you have ſeene, muſt take their grounds from inferiour truths in the creature, which are utterly unfit for that generation which is eternall and Divine: for to whom ſhall wee liken the higheſt, or who ſhall declare his generation? and therefore <hi>Athanaſius Epiſt. contra Arianos, cujus initium</hi>

The Fathers alſo in the <hi>Nicen</hi> Councell to that queſtion of <hi>Phaedo</hi> the patron of <hi>Arius,</hi> how the Sonne was begotten of the Father? anſwered, that this queſtion is not to be asked: for ſeeing the creatures were not ever, they could not make anſwer concerning his originall that was eternall.

The Father hath appointed mee a body, and creating me among men, hath ordeined me the Saviour of mankinde: which though it be true; yet is it not a fit interpretation for that text, if yee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the circumſtances before and after. The Fathers alſo of the Nicene coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell being urged with this text anſwered from that addition, the beginning of his wayes, that the world was created for man: ſo that man the reaſonable or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſive wiſdome of God, as concerning the intent and purpoſe of God, was firſt created, although laſt in the order of actuall being. <hi>Epiphan. haereſ.</hi> 69. in anſwer hereto, holds the diſtinction of wiſdome created and increated: but ſeeing no place of the Scripture expounds this place of Chriſt, therefore (ſaith he) it is not neceſſary to interpret it of the Sonne of God: but if you take the other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, it can belong to no other. Then if it muſt needs be referred to Chriſt, yet ſhall it be verified of his humane, not of his divine nature. At laſt he gives the true meaning of the word <gap reason="foreign">

But Chriſt ſaith of himſelfe, <hi>Math.</hi> 19.27. <hi>why calleſt thou me good? there is none good but one, even God. Anſw.</hi> Good is either abſolute and perfect, which is God alone, or elſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, the image of that Good: and ſo every thing created was very good, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.

In theſe three kindes our Lord was good as man ſupereminently, above all the orders of created things.

I <hi>anſwer.</hi> that this life which the Sonne receives of the Father is not accidentall, not of grace, not of foreſight or purpoſe: but ſubſtantiall and eternall, ſeeing the generation is according to the immutable being and eternall working of the Father, and his ſpirituall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection onely. So they object from <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.2. That hee was faithfull to him that made him, and <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.28.

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:107656:106"/>which ſignifie his nature, and thoſe which have reference to the office of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorſhip, as in the firſt place of <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. Conſider what he was made. It is plaine by the verſes before, hee was made the Apoſtle and high Prieſt of our profeſſion, in which office he was faithfull to him that made him, or appointed him thereunto; ſo in the ſecond place, to that, <hi>The Father is greater than I;</hi> note the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Divine and humane nature: for the Sonne is inferiour to the Father, by nature, as man; and ſo as he is the Mediatour in the diſpenſation of his offices, as with us he makes up the body of his Church: nay, even in the Divine nature the Father is that eternall fountaine whence the Sonne hath his eternall origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, although the honour of ſending takes not away the equalitie of power, nor the excellencie of nature from him that is ſent; ſo the greatneſſe there ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, is with reſpect of the office of the Sonne ſent into the world, that the world by him might be ſaved. In the third place of delivering the kingdome to God the Father, note the communication of idiomes or proprieties of ſpeech according to the rules of <hi>Theodoret.</hi> That the words proper to either nature, become common and indifferent to the Perſon, <hi>as the God of glory was crucified,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8. that is, that Perſon which is the God of glorie, was crucified con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his humane nature. Secondly, that the communitie of names makes no confuſion in natures: now the word <hi>Sonne</hi> belongs to Chriſt indifferently, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as he is the Sonne of God, and ſo ſhall hee raigne with the Father, and the holy Ghoſt eternally, and of his kingdome there ſhall be no end, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.36. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.33. And ſeeing that he as the Son of man, hath received all power, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18. <hi>John</hi> 3.35. and 13 3. as to governe his Church <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. ſo to raiſe the dead, and to execute judgement, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.26, 27. <hi>Acts</hi> 17.31. Hee ſhall raigne till all things bee ſubdued unto him, and that he hath utterlie deſtroyed all the workes of the devill, ſinne, ignorance and death, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.3.8. that as God the Father doth now raigne by him; ſo he having performed all things which belong to him as the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, may thereafter as God raigne with the Father eternally, our everlaſting king of glory, when God ſhall be all in all his children, as he is in him.</p>
                           <p>I am the more briefe in this argument; becauſe their arguments are anſwered in part before. § 4. And becauſe this queſtion is neere to that which followes immediately, and againe becauſe it is the principall ſubject of that treariſe by me ſo often mentioned: therefore for concluſion, firſt conſider the danger of this venome which at once poyſons all our hopes of that full ſatisfaction which is made unto the juſtice of God by the death of Chriſt: for if he be a creature only, then can he not be infinite, and if not infinite, then cannot the infinite juſtice that is offended by our ſinnes, receive a full and ſufficient ſatisfaction by him, as you might ſee it proved in the 21 Chapter before. And beſide theſe reaſons you may take with you theſe remembrances againſt all <hi>Arians, Turkes, Iewes, Socinians,</hi> and other hereticks whatſoever, and give honour and glory unto Ieſus our Lord and God. <hi>Eſay</hi> 9.6. <hi>Vnto us a childe is borne, unto us a Sonne is given, and his name ſhall be called, The Mightie God, the Everlaſting Father, the prince of peace.

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:107656:106"/>beeing is, that ſeeing all fulneſſe muſt dwell in him, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.19. whether he be not alſo that firſt created being, in and by whom all other things were created and are governed and preſerved. This <hi>Poſtellus</hi> in his booke <hi>De nativitate Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toris,</hi> doth firmly hold: And although it be plaine by <hi>Athanaſius, Epiſt</hi> 1. <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Arianos,</hi> that <hi>Arius</hi> held one Word in the Father, as we ſpeak of the Trinity, and another Word created, which he held to be Chriſt: and in his <hi>Thaleia,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2. <hi>contra Arianos,</hi> affirmes to the ſame purpoſe, a Wiſdome increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and a Wiſedome created: and although <hi>Arius</hi> affirmed as <hi>Poſtellus,</hi> That Chriſt was a creature, but not as one of the creatures; made, but not as one of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things that were made, &amp;c. and therefore concluded that he held the ſame faith with the Church, and detracted nothing from the glory of Chriſt, when hee called him the firſt and chiefe creature, <hi>Epiph. haereſ.</hi> 69. yet <hi>Poſtellus,</hi> whether he were indeed ignorant of it, or whether he diſſembled his knowledge, makes no mention thereof, leſt the name <hi>Arius</hi> might diſcredit the poſition, although the difference betweene <hi>Arius</hi> and <hi>Poſtellus,</hi> be as much as from the Eaſt to the Weſt. For though <hi>Arius</hi> held the increated Wiſdome or Word to be in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, yet he could not yeeld to this, that that Wiſdome tooke fleſh, and became that Saviour to whom we confeſſe. And this was the buſineſſe betweene him and the right meaning Fathers. But <hi>Poſtellus</hi> held that the created Wiſdome, that firſt borne of every creature, which in the fulneſſe of time tooke fleſh of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and in that fleſh made ſatisfaction for the ſinnes of the world, was hee in whom all the fulneſſe of the Godhead did dwell. Now by the rule of our faith both the extremities are yeelded unto, that Chriſt is God, bleſſed above all; and that he is man, as hath beene proved. But this is now to be examined, whether it be neceſſary, to the beeing of our mediatour, that hee be that firſt creature of God, created before all times and ages of the world, by whom all other things were afterwards made in their due times, and are governed, as <hi>Poſtellus</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed. The Authorities which <hi>Poſtellus</hi> brings, are either forraine, or elſe out of the holy Scripture; you ſhall firſt ſee them of the firſt kind, with their exceptions, then his reaſons with their anſwers, and laſtly thoſe enforcements which are by him, and may beſide bee brought from the Word of truth.</p>

The ſecond authority is that of the <hi>Abiſine</hi> Church, which commonly they call of <hi>Presbyter Iohn,</hi> out of whoſe Creed he cites for his purpoſe thus much, <hi>Pag.</hi> 24. <hi>&amp;</hi> 25. <q>We beleeve in the name of the holy Trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghoſt, who is one Lord: three names, one Deity; three Faces, one Similitude: the conjunction of the three perſons is equall in their Godhead; one Kingdome, one Throne, one Iudge, one Love, one Word, one Spirit. But there is a Word of the Father, a Word of the Soune, and a Word of the Holy Ghoſt: and the Son is the ſame Word: And the Word was with God, and with the Holy Ghoſt, and with himſelfe, without any defect or diviſion; the Sonne of the Father, the Sonne of himſelfe, and the beginning of himſelfe.</q> Where in the firſt Article (you ſee) that Church acknowledges the Trinitie of Perſons, in the unitie of the Deity, according to that faith which wee beleeve. The ſecond Article, But there is a Word of the Father, &amp;c. is altogether a declaration of this created Word, of Sonne of God, by whom all the holy Scriptures were given, and inſpired, as <hi>Poſtel</hi> ſpeakes. But concerning that Church, though <hi>Poſtel</hi> to make the authority thereof without exception, ſay, it was never troubled with any hereſie; yet it is not unlikely to have nurſed that arch-heretick <hi>Arius,</hi> whom all writers account to be a <hi>Lybian.</hi> Beſides, it is manifeſt, that they are all <hi>Monothelites,</hi> and ſo farre forth <hi>Iacobites</hi> or <hi>Eutychians,</hi> that
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:107656:107"/>they condemne the fourth generall Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> for determining two natures to be in Chriſt.

So <hi>Raimund Lully Artis Magnae parte.</hi> 9. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. hath this. By this meanes mans underſtanding knowes, that there is one great created being, which is greater than all the creature beſide; which I dare neither name nor declare in this place, becauſe this Art is generall. Alſo <hi>Iohn Picus</hi> makes it the firſt of his concluſions, according to the <hi>Chaldees.</hi> That the firſt order of ſeparate or created beings, is that of the fountaine, which by the meanes of viſion is ſuperexalted above all the reſt: as I even now explaned the ſuperiour <hi>Shekinah,</hi> or habitation of the Cabaliſts. But this concluſion of <hi>Picus,</hi> is after the later interpreters of the <hi>Chaldaean</hi> Theology. For if you looke unto the oracle <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap>, &amp;c. You ſhall ſee that both <hi>Plethon</hi> and <hi>Pſellus</hi> interpret it thus. That the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Father is utterly imcomprehenſible, and beyond the underſtanding not only of men and Angels, but alſo of the Sonne himſelfe: and this not out of any envie, but onely by the impoſſibility of the thing: that that which is infinite ſhould be apprehended by a finite and created being. The <hi>Arians</hi> follow this, but <hi>Pſellus</hi> rejects it, as contrary toour Chriſtian doctrine. Alſo<note n="*" place="margin">See Aug. de Civ. lib. <hi>10.</hi> cap. <hi>2</hi>

Onely it ſeemes that ſeeing a famous Chriſtian Church, and ſo many great Doctors, and expoſitors beſide (though the Chaldae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and Platonicks be ſet at naught) were of this Iudgement, ſeeing no Synod ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther oecumenicall or nationall (forought that I know) did ever condemne it, it may be held as an opinion not utterly hereticall; eſpecially ſeeing the booke of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> both by the warrant of ſome fathers, and other Churches, and eſpecially of our owne, hath been commended as profitable to the advancement of Chriſtian vertue, though not for the eſtabliſhment of doctrine <hi>Art.</hi> 6.

                           <p n="1">1. But <hi>Poſtellus</hi> to aſcertaine this matier to the underſtanding, brings theſe
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:107656:108"/>reaſons following. Firſt, God is altogether unmoveable, as in place, becauſe he fills all; ſo likewiſe in wiſedome and in will, becauſe hee is every way infinite. And therefore it was neceſſary in the creation (which was not but with a moſt particular diſpenſation or providence, by which all cauſes and effects are orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) that there ſhould be an agent which gave to every thing a being, and that a ſeverall, and diſtinct individuall being, which cannot bee, but by thoſe ſpecificall formes or proprieties by which every thing doth worke according to kinde; which could not bee but by ſuch an agent as hath both an infinite activity of being, by which he is one with God, and likewiſe an infinite poſſibility of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, or not working, according to the particular poſſibilities in nature, by which hee muſt of neceſſitie communicate with the Creature. And this is that Wiſedome created and increate, without which nothing was made. This both the Creator and the Creature, that forme of formes, in whom, by whom, and for whom are all things: <hi>pag.</hi> 21. 103, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>I anſwer.</hi> That if it muſt of neceſſitie be put, that God cannot worke without Himſelfe, becauſe. He is infinite, and therefore immoveable; then for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it muſt follow, that no ſuch great created being can at all be, except you will ſay that hee created himſelfe, and ſo was when He was nor, or that hee had his creation from ſome other originall than God, which muſt likewiſe bee infinite, in being able to create ſo excellent a being, and yet finite, that hee might move or not move himſelfe thereto when he would. But firſt this progreſſe would be infinite, and beſide that impoſſible. For if neither God could move becauſe Hee is infinite, nor much leſſe the creature when it was not, how was it poſſible that any thing at all ſhould be created? Secondly, Moreover it would follow here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, that that were poſſible to the ſecond cauſe, which was not poſſible to the firſt: but it is manifeſt, that all ſecond cauſes worke onely by the activity of the firſt, ſo that if the firſt cauſe ceaſe to worke, much more the ſecond. Thirdly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide this, the power of God ſhould not be infinite, if it could not worke accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his pleaſure in things without.</p>
                           <p>But you ſay, as Himſelfe, ſo His action is infinite, and it is impoſſible that a finite being ſhould be the ſubject of an infinite action. I ſay though <hi>Sampſon</hi> were able to breake a Cable, yet might he ſtraine one haire of <hi>Dalilah</hi> to ſtraightnes, not to lengthen it; to lengthen it, not to breake it. This is true (ſay you) becauſe he was as every creature, partaker of being, and not being; of act or perfection, and of poſſibilities, or imperfection, whereby he might move, or not move at his pleaſure. But God is not ſo; but alwaies actually, whatſoever Hee may be. But (ſay I) it is one thing to ſpeake of the infinite action of God in himſelfe; and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of his action in the creature, limited according to his Wiſdome and His Will in reſpect of the outward object, as I have ſhewed at large in anſwer to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections for the worlds eternity <hi>chap.</hi> 13. <hi>note (b) ob.</hi> 2.3.4. Neither is the will of God without an infinite Wiſedome to diſpoſe of all things in their times, nor yet without an infinite power, to cauſe every thing to bee actually according to His Wiſdome and His will, and the application of his will, wiſdome and power, is ſufficient to move all inferiour cauſes to give all manner of beeing to the Creature.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. But ſeeing the matier, and forme of all things, are after a ſort contrary; and that the bodily compoſition likewiſe of things below is of elements contrary in their qualities: it is impoſſible that theſe repugnances ſhould be brought to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into one, <hi>nat.

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:107656:108"/>neither their reaſon, nor their authority ſhall bee of any force with us. But this is without all doubt, that hee that had power to create all things, had likewiſe power out of that created maſſe, fruitfull with the ſeed of all things, to bring out every thing in due time according to the kindes that were by him fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene and determined. And becauſe wee have hitherto maintayned that God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone by his eternall wiſdome, <hi>Our Lord Ieſus Chriſt</hi> was the Creator, it muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of neceſſity, that the creature was alſo ordered and guided by Him. For that infinite power which could doe the more, and cauſe that to bee which was not, might alſo doe the leſſe, and order it at his will. So that for this objection wee are not compelled to acknowledge any ſuch created being, the Creator and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer of all the reſt. And concerning that ſuppoſed repugnancy betweene the matier and forme of every thing, it is but the begging of the queſtion, for all formes are produced out of poſſibilities of their matier, excepting onely the ſoule of man, and the divine endowments thereof, as I ſhewed at large, <hi>chap.</hi> 17. §. 4. <hi>n.</hi> 2.</p>

For nature brings out nothing violently or in an inſtant: therefore as the things that are; began by little and little to bee, by the power of the Spirit of God, which moved upon the waters: ſo by the power of the ſame Spirit, are they ſtill preſerved in their order of being, and by it they are changed from ſtate to ſtate. And this ſpirit of God is that firſt created being, that Mediator betweene God and the creature: the ſpirit of the Vniverſe actually moveable, and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelfe to every thing, and working in every thing by the power of the Trinity which dwelleth in Him. For nothing which proceedes from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the matier, is able to move it ſelfe, no more than the matier was, no not the ſoule of man, but onely by His ſtrength and activity by whoſe power it is.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Concerning the progreſſe of things naturall, from the evening of their beginning, to the morning of their perfection, I have ſpoken before. But for anſwer to this, I ſay that it is not neceſſary to put any ſuch ſpirit of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, ſuch an applyable divinity, as the <hi>Platonicks</hi> call <hi>Animam Mundi,</hi> becauſe things are changed from one ſtate of being to another; ſeeing the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tels us. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148.5. that all the armies of the creature were made, becauſe God commanded. And for their changes in corruption and generation it is plaine, it muſt be according to that degree which they cannot paſſe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. which is the law of nature. And moreover concerning the providence of God on every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular thing, our Lord hath taught us, <hi>Math.</hi> 10.29. that not a Sparrow fals to the ground without the will of our heavenly Father; except <hi>Poſtellus</hi> will here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that that heavenly Father muſt ſignifie that firſt begotten of the creature, which he doth meane. Which interpretation would directly croſſe that text, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.18. That all the workes of God were knowne to Him from everlaſting. And nothing can bee in the ſecond cauſe which was not in the firſt. Therefore ſeeing the infinite power of God is that by which every thing is powerfull, to worke unto that end, whereto it was deſtinate: we muſt needs confeſſe, that Hee by His power workes what He will both in Heaven and in earth; and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all the orders of cauſes are appointed by him, wee may ſafely ſay as our Lord hath taught us, <hi>Mark.</hi> 4.28. That the earth of her owne accord bringeth forth fruit, and as the Prophet, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1.21.22. <hi>I will heare the heavens, and the heavens ſhall heare the earth, and the earth ſhall heare the corne and the wine; and the corne and the wine ſhall heare Iſrael.</hi> Which order of cauſes being put, we ſhall not need to apply the immediate power of that applyable divinity of the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to every effect, as <hi>Poſtellus</hi> holds it neceſſary. For the whole creature by the power of that bleſſing which it received at the creation is able to worke accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:107656:109"/>to the end appointed. And if it were neceſſary to put any common agent in the Creature, by which every inferiour Agent were to bee moved, which wee cannot doe except we hold that Gods decree the law of nature is too weake, or may be broken; yet I thinke that the dominion of the heavens ſet in the earth, <hi>Iob.</hi> 38.33. or that ſame <hi>anima mundi</hi> here below mentioned may better ſtand with the Scripture, than the perpetuall imployment of this ſuppoſed mediator. That I ſay nothing of thoſe particular intelligences which ſome Philoſophers, &amp; <hi>Poſtel</hi> himſelfe <hi>pag.</hi> 63. have appropriated to every thing, beſide the ſpecificall vertue of the ſeed. Neither is it cleare that this ſpirit which moved upon the waters, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2. was any ſuch being as <hi>Poſtellus</hi> ſuppoſes, a created divinity, or the mediator betweene God and his creature; but rather that vigor, life, or heat concreated with the <hi>Chaos</hi> that <gap reason="foreign">

Maur. Enar. in Gen.</hi> If you love to conferre opinions, you may read, <hi>Ioh. Pici Heptaplum,</hi> D. <hi>Willet</hi> and other expoſitors.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. To theſe reaſons of <hi>Poſtellus</hi> you may adde a fourth, every action is limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the object, ſo the eternall and infinite action of God the Father underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelfe, doth thereby produce the eternal Sonne as hath beene further ſaid chap. 11. But becauſe the Father doth alſo view all the poſſibilities of being in the creature, and that the creature muſt needes ſtand in cleare diſtinction from the Creator, therefore as the eternall Sonne is the image of the Father, ſo that idea or image of the creature muſt needes bee a different being from that i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Father, which wee call the eternall Sonne, and ſo of neceſſity muſt come into the reckoning of the creature. For the true image of every thing, muſt be like to that whoſe image it is.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſwer.</hi> If the image of the things created, were repreſented to the divine underſtanding from any thing which is without himſelfe, the reaſon were of force But ſeeing that God knowes all things, only in and by his owne being, by which being of his only, as the cauſe of all things, all things have their poſſibilitie of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſo that his being is the foundation of all beings; it followes that the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the divine being, which wee call the Sonne, is alſo the ſimilitude or repreſentation of all thoſe poſſibilities of being which are in him, ſo that the creature is in God the Father as the firſt cauſe of all equivalently; ſith his being is equivalent to all being, and the poſſibilities thereof. In the Sonne, the idea of all being it is as repreſented or characterized eminently, or viſibly, to the divine underſtanding, and by Him all naturall cauſes and poſſibilities are ordered, to the bringing of all things into their actuall being. And therefore as Chriſt our Lord, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. is called the expreſſe image of the Perſon of the Father, ſo likewiſe, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15. is hee the firſt begotten of every creature. For ſeeing the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of God is not by diſcourſe, nor habituall, as gotten by experience, but that it is His owne very being unto the perfection whereof all the termes of Action muſt of neceſſity concurre, that is, both of Him that underſtands, and of the obiect underſtood, and of the action of underſtanding, as was ſhewed, <hi>chapter</hi> 11. <hi>Rea.</hi> 8. it is not poſſible, but that ſeeing they are all infinite, they muſt
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:107656:109"/>alſo bee coeſſentiall and one; and if one, then the action of underſtanding whereby God vieweth himſelfe, muſt alſo bee that whereby hee vieweth the creature, for otherwiſe it were not infinite, if it comprehended not all beings at once. So then in this action of Gods underſtanding, there cannot bee a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oritie of an infinite being underſtood, that is, God the Sonne, and a poſterioritie of a finite, that is, the creature.</p>
                           <p>By this meanes (you ſay) I make the Creature to be coeſſentiall with God, in which inconvenience, the ſtrength of the former objection doth ſtand.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſw.</hi> If you meane the Creature, according to the actuall being, I put it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally in the precedent cauſes, and poſſibilities of nature; but as concerning the firſt and prime cauſe, it is ſo farre from any inconvenience: that it is moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that God, and the firſt cauſe of all being beſide Himſelfe, be termes converti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eſſentially: And thus the Creature is in God as in the cauſe. But ſeeing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be in another, but according to the manner of that being wherein it is; and ſeeing the being of God is his moſt Pure underſtanding, the Creature is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe in him, but as underſtood or foreſeene, and willed eternally.</p>
                           <p>And if you will ſtay to ſee, you may in the Perſons of the holy Trinity view a wonderfull preſentation of the perfections of the Creature. The Father is the foundation that ſuſtaines all: The Sonne or Mediator that power or efficacie which perfecteth all. The Holy Ghoſt that infinite activity in the ſtrength of which every thing doth worke. The number three, ſuppoſes two: and becauſe neither to worke outwardly, nor to will within, can bee where there is not a power thereto; therefore our Lord ſaith <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.5. <hi>Without mee yee can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> And ſecondly ſuppoſes, firſt ſo, that power cannot bee without a being wherein it dwels. And thus you ſee the Father the foundation of all being, is more inward to every thing than the matier thereof, the Sonne more eſſentiall than the forme, and the holy Ghoſt more proper than any working: for of his activitie it is, that we will or doe, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.13. and thus is that Scripture vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied which is in <hi>Acts</hi> 17. In him, firſt we are, ſecondly live, thirdly move.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. A fifth reaſon of <hi>Poſtellus</hi> which I ſet over of purpoſe is pag. 74. and this it is. Seeing that God in his infinitie is utterly incomprehenſible of the creature, if ſuch a created Mediator were not, in whom the infinite Majeſtie dwelling might be apprehended, the Angels had beene created in vaine: for neither had they enjoyed happineſſe, when they could have no ſight of God in whom alone bleſſedneſſe is; nor yet God had perfected his praiſe in them, when they could not ſee and praiſe the Divine Majeſtie. And againe to the ſame purpoſe pag. 118. Seeing mans underſtanding above all other things deſires and ſearches the knowledge of the truth; and that not onely in things below during this life, but moſt of all being ſeparate in the eternall and infinite goodneſſe, wiſdome, and other dignities of God, wherein above all other things it takes moſt joy: it is neceſſarie that it may come unto the knowledge of that truth by ſuch a mean as is proportionable and fit thereto: for otherwiſe the deſire were in vaine if it could never bee brought to effect. Therefore ſeeing our underſtanding cannot behold the infinite being it ſelfe, it is neceſſarie that it behold it in the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, a created being, and proportionable to our underſtanding, and this may ſeeme to bee that which our Lord ſaith of himſelfe, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.6. <hi>No man commeth to the Father but by me, See Iohn</hi> 1.18. and againe <hi>Luke</hi> 10.22. <hi>No man knoweth the Father but the Sonne, and he to whom the Sonne will reveale him.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>For anſwer to this doubt, you muſt remember that which was ſaid to the laſt objection concerning the being of things equivalently, and eminently; for your eaſier underſtanding I will cleere it further. Things, be they naturall or artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, are either actually in that being which they have, whether it be ſubſtantiall or accidentall, as <hi>Plato</hi> to bee a man, to bee a Philoſopher; this ſword to bee of Steele, well tempered, two foot and nine inches long; or elſe potentially, and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:107656:110"/>ſo they are in their proper principles and cauſes, before they come to actuall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and theſe cauſes are either next, as the Steele out of which the ſword was forged, the Smith that made it, the fire that ſoftned it, the hammer, the grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, and ſuch like inſtruments; or elſe the cauſes are further and further off from the effect; as iron which was fined to ſteele, the ſtone out of which the yron was molten, the quickſilver and Sulphure which were congealed into that ſtone, the earth and water of which they had their beginning. <hi>Poſtel</hi> put things potentially in the Angels, but ill; for they can be but in the order of efficients at moſt. Thirdly, things are ſaid to be in their ideas or ſeparate formes eminently, as the model of a houſe in the minde of the builder; or as the forme of the ſword was in the minde or underſtanding of the Smith, when he firſt purpoſed to make it. Fourthly, things are equivalently in that common cauſe wherein all other things of the ſame kinde may be, as in an Organ or Virginall, all manner of tunes, all concords, and diſcords are, which are poſſible to bee made or concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by any Muſician; ſo in the minde of the Smith, all the objects of Smithery, locks, guns, ſwords, and the like are equivalently, though as yet hee hath not thought or purpoſed any one in particular. Now from theſe common things en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large your underſtanding to thoſe reſpects that are fit to be betweene things ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and the unſearchable Trinity. All things are in God the Father equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, becauſe in that infinite being of his all the poſſibility of being is founded: of all things (I ſay) that have beene or ſhall be eternally. But becauſe his being is actuall, with all the dignities of being actually: for other wiſe it were not infinite; if it might be more excellent than it is: therefore doth hee in his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Sonne underſtand both himſelfe in his actuall being, and actually all things that are by his being poſſible to bee; ſo that the ideas or formes of all things are actually preſent with him eternally, and actually under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as it is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.16. <hi>In thy booke all my members were written, when as yet there was none of them.</hi> Wherefore it muſt follow that that <hi>Word</hi> which is the character or expreſſe image of the Father, bee alſo the image of all other things whatſoever; ſo that all the ideas of all things poſſible to be, muſt bee in the Sonne eminently, that is, according to their ideas or particular formes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, and determined, as the idea or imagination of the ſword is in the minde of the Smith actually, aſſoone as the Smith hath reſolved to make it thus, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the ſword it ſelfe be not actually till it bee made. And as theſe ideas are the firſt cauſes of things; ſo by reaſon of the concurrence of the will with the underſtanding, are they the moſt powerfull for the bringing of thoſe things whoſe Ideas they are, into effect: for from that idea of the ſword in the Smith it is, that he kindles the fire, ſoftens his ſteele, forges it, grindes it, forbuſhes it, and makes it at laſt a perfect ſword. And therefore though it bee true, <hi>That the Sonne doth nothing of himſelfe, ſaving what hee hath ſeene with the Father. Iohn</hi> 5 19. Yet becauſe the ideas of all things are actually in him, it is as true that <hi>in him, through him, for him, and by him, are all things; and in him all things conſiſt. See Chap.</hi> 13. § 9. eminently, or in the cleere diſtinction of their ſeverall formes: for otherwiſe the wiſdome were not infinite, if the formes were in confuſion, and not eminent and apparent in their moſt cleare differences and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations of the times, and limits, when, and how, the things themſelves whoſe formes they are, ſhould actually be. If then the ideas of all things be in the Sonne actually; what neceſſitie is there of any created Mediatour, when the Son of God might by any of theſe Ideas which are actually in him, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt himſelfe either to Angels, or to men? was not then that image of the manly being in him, in which he did delight to dwell with the ſonnes of men, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.31. according to which he created <hi>Adam?</hi> in which hee manifeſted himſelfe to the Fathers, to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> to the Prophets? And although for ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie purpoſes knowne to his wiſdome, he manifeſted himſelfe in other formes:
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:107656:110"/>of a ſmoking furace, when hee entred into covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> his friend, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.17. of a living fire that conſumed not the buſh, to <hi>Moſes, Ex.</hi> 3.2.6. of a ſtill ſoft voice to <hi>Eliah,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.12. or the like: yet none of theſe formes were uncouth, or forreine to him. So that in what forme ſoever he vouchſafed to ſhew himſelfe to the Angels, in that might they behold the inviſible God, and be abundantly bleſſed thereby; but ſince the time that the faithfull have beheld him with that Crowne, wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſals, the day of the joy and gladneſſe of his heart, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.11. He is to be ſeene both of Angels and men eternally, and onely in the Tabernacle of our fleſh; and the glory of God is manifeſt onely in the face of Ieſus Chriſt. And as this (I thinke) is a full anſwer to the argument of <hi>Poſtellus;</hi> ſo had you need to remember it, becauſe it may helpe to the underſtanding of ſome places of Scripture, which may ſeeme to make for this concluſion.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. But if ſuch a created Mediatour be, as had power to execute the eternall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, and to create thereſt of the creature, the Angels, and man, and all this viſible world from him; it may ſtand well with the juſtice and honour of God, and the love of that Mediatour toward man, to offer himſelfe for man when hee had ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: whereas otherwiſe if no ſuch created Mediatour bee, then God the party offended, muſt firſt ſeeke the attonement: and ſeeing man was not able, muſt likewiſe make ſatisfaction to himſelfe, for the ſinne of another againſt himſelfe: But this ſtands neither with the honour of God, nor the rule of Iuſtice.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſw.</hi> Intire affection hates all nicity: And ſo God loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Son, that the world through him might be ſaved. And if the onely begotten Sonne, be onely that ſecond perſon of the Trinity, what Son is that created Mediatour? And ſo farre is it from diſhonour to God to ſeeke and ſave that which was loſt, as that without his mercy and pitie on man in his miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the worke of God in the creature had beene in vaine. But concerning that ſatisfaction which was made for ſinne, although it had appeared that it was ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly impoſſible to bee made by one that was onely man, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. yet was the ſatisfaction made onely in the manhood of our Saviour, dignified and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained by his divinity, unto the endurance of all that puniſhment which was due to our ſinne, as it is manifeſt by the Prophet <hi>Eſay, chap.</hi> 53. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.22. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. and yet for all that, is our Saviour the Lambe ſlaine from the beginning of the world, <hi>Re.</hi> 13.8. yet is the blood of his ſacrifice upon the Croſſe, called the blood of the everlaſting Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.20. becauſe that by the eternall ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, he offered himſelfe for us unto God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. <hi>That he in his manhood might preſent his Church unto himſelfe, God bleſſed for ever, holy and without blemiſh, Eph.</hi> 5.27. So that the redemption of man is the worke of the whole Trinitie, the Sonne by the holy Spirit offering himſelfe unto the Father, accepting this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience a ranſome for the world. And becauſe the Sonne offered himſelfe by the eternall Spirit; therefore is not our Saviour a created Mediatour, as <hi>Poſtellus</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, for no creature can be eternall. And malgre all the power of hell, it was an eternall Goſpell, <hi>Revel.</hi> 14.6. Written in the Volume of the Booke of the eternall Decree, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.7. to the everlaſting comfort of the faithfull; That the ſacrifice for ſinne was appointed before there was a ſinner.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. Now before I come to thoſe Texts of Scripture which <hi>Poſtel</hi> urges directly hereto; it will not bee unfit to let you ſee how he favours his owne opinion, by thoſe Scriptures which he interprets unfaithfully; as where it is ſaid, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.39. <hi>There is no God with me;</hi> as <hi>Eſay</hi> interprets it, <hi>I am God, and there is none elſe;</hi> he makes the ſenſe, <hi>pag.</hi> 104. he is the created wiſdome, before which there was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God created: for he is worthily called God (ſaith he) for his union with the Deitie. And againe, <hi>pag.</hi> 115. for that which is <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.23. <hi>I was ſet up from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting;</hi> he will have it, that this divine wiſdome was created not from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, for then it could not be a creature; but before any ages were numbred by
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:107656:111"/>men. So to that of Saint <hi>Iohn, Cap.</hi> 1. <hi>The Word was with God;</hi> he addes as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, in the <hi>Abiſine Creed,</hi> and with the Holy Ghoſt, and with himſelf, &amp; argues that whoſoever is with another, muſt be different therfrom, &amp; (for the moſt part) inferiour indignity. I have anſwered concerning the authority of that Church, the collection of inferiority in dignity followes not; neither doth this text prove the unity of any ſuch creature with the Creator, as hee inferres, but rather the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of perſons in the unity of the Godhead: for ſo it followes in the Text; <hi>And that Word was God.</hi> I ſay nothing of other Texts which by allegoricall and forraine interpretations he would bring to his purpoſe, ſuch as that, <hi>pag.</hi> 93. where by the firmament, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.6. he will underſtand this Mediator, who parted the hidden waters of the Deitie, from the manifeſt waters of the creature: whereby it would follow, that the <hi>Chaos</hi> or waters, the light and darkneſſe, were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before this Mediator, ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.13. His argument from that Spirit which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon the waters, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. brought <hi>pag.</hi> 29. is anſwered before, Reaſon 3.</p>
                           <p>I impute it no fault to him, that he <hi>pag.</hi> 62. confounds thoſe Texts of <hi>Iohn,</hi> 12.28. and <hi>chap.</hi> 17.5. Charity ſees no miſtakings, where they make not againſt the truth. But his collection is ill from that text, <hi>Glorifie me with that glory which I had with thee before the world was;</hi> to conclude, either that the creatures were diſtinct in him whom he cals God man, meaning the created Mediatour, or for any other to ſuppoſe that the glory of God the Sonne was any whit leſſened by the taking of our fleſh; onely it was ſhadowed for a time under the Cloud of his humanity, except that at ſome times a glimpſe therof appeared in his glorious mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. For firſt, if that eminent being of the creatures in the diſtinction of their ſeverall beings, were not in God the Sonne, that ſecond Perſon of the Trinity, but in this created Mediator; it would follow, that the wiſdome of God were not infinite, nor yet eſſentiall unto him, when the knowledge of the creature in that manner of being, muſt come unto him by a creature, contrary to that which hath been proved (<hi>Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8. And therefore to avoid this inconvenience, hee is compelled to ſay, <hi>pag.</hi> 74. that that ſecond being of all things (taking the equivalent being which they have in the Father, for the firſt) is not onely in the eternall wiſedome, but alſo in the wiſdome created. Whence it followes, that the Creature by the ſame manner of being, ſhall bee both in the Creator, and in the created Mediator. But the reaſon: for otherwiſe the Angels could no ſee God. The poſition is falſe, the reaſon inſufficient, and anſwered before; then to thinke that the Sonne had loſt or abated any thing of his infinite glory, becauſe he prayes, that he may be glorified as before the world was, ſtands neither with the truth. For ſo neither had the glory beene infinite, if once ended, nor he coeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall with the Father: neither yet accords it with the circumſtance of the Text. Therefore underſtand it according to the truth: That Chriſt the Sonne of God in his manly being having glorified the Father on earth, and finiſhed that worke which he had given him to doe, <hi>Verſe</hi> 4. prayeth <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. that the infinite glory, which was darkned under the forme of a ſervant, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.27. might be manifeſt in the manhood, that hee in that manly being might be glorified, with the glorie which is infinitely ſufficient to glorifie him the head, and all the members of his myſticall body, as it is manifeſt in that 17. <hi>chap.</hi> of <hi>Iohn, verſ.</hi> 22, 23, 24.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1. Chriſt is called the Angel or Meſſenger of the Covenant; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is a creature, ſo united to the Divinity, that God cannot worke without him, for that reaſon which is the firſt before. The reaſon is not of force to the authority. I anſwer. The firſt covenant or promiſe which God made to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde was that in Paradiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. <hi>The ſeed of the woman ſhall bruiſe the head of the Serpent.</hi> This ſeed of the woman is Chriſt our Lord, which according to the Prophet ſhould come in that Temple, which was built by the Iewes after their returne from Babylon: So the Sonne of God in our fleſh, is that Angel of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of our deliverance from the power of the Devill, which came according
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:107656:111"/>to the time appointed. So he hath the name of an Angel from his office, not from his nature.</p>

This holy Ghoſt is that created Spirit of the Trinity, locally moving from place to place, which actually performed all thoſe things which hitherto have beene ignorantly attributed to the third Perſon of the Trinity: who being infinite, and filling all places, cannot be moved from place to place, no more than the Father or the Sonne. But this created Spirit might take on him the ſhape of a Dove, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.22. of a Voice <hi>Luke</hi> 9.35. and may alſo change places, as he ſaith, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.13. <hi>No man aſcended up into heaven, but the Sonne of man which is in heaven, pag,</hi> 75.75 113, 116, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                              <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have given the meaning of that text, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.13. before in the 23. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: And as the infinite wiſdome of God foreſaw, what diverſitie of opinions would come into mens minds, (for hee underſtands their thoughts long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.2) ſo hath hee left us the rule of his holy word whereby to guide us in the truth. Now the writings of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> do ſo cleare this queſtion, as if they had beene written in oppoſition to theſe opinions of <hi>Arius Poſtellus,</hi> and thoſe that are like minded. I cite ſome few texts out of his firſt Epiſtle <hi>chap.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 10. God hath loved us, and ſent his Sonne to bee a reconciliation. But the queſtion is, whether a created Sonne or no? Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> tels us no, not a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Sonne, but his onely begotten Sonne hath hee ſent into the world, that wee might be ſaved by him <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. That Sonne or Word, who is one with the Father and the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>chap.</hi> 5. <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. That Sonne to whom the Father Himſelfe bare witneſſe, <hi>verſe</hi> 9.10 11.

If Hee bee begotten, then coeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall with the Father, <hi>Ergo,</hi> not created. If begotten, then eternall (for the actions of God in Himſelfe are infinite and eternall) See <hi>chapter</hi> 10. <hi>Ergo,</hi> not created. If one with the Father, then alſo infinite. <hi>Ergo,</hi> not crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. If very God, <hi>Ergo,</hi> not a Creature. But this ſpirit of the Trinity, which tooke fleſh of the Virgin, and ſo became our Mediatour, moved from place to place, which no Perſon of the Trinitie could doe, becauſe they are infinite, and fill all places. Had this eye of the Sorbon <hi>L. Dan: in Haer. Aug. cap.</hi> 85. which knew ſo well that God is in all places <hi>repletivè</hi> (as they ſpeake) never read that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.26. That God rides on the Heavens for the helpe of Iſrael, and on the Clouds in his glory? And although <hi>David</hi> knew that God did continually, beſet him round about, and that there was no place either in Heaven or in hell, in the earth, or Sea: where he was not <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. from <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>to</hi> 11. yet as a ſtag emboſſed takes the ſoyle, ſo did his heart in his flight from <hi>Saul</hi> thirſt for God; ſaying, <hi>when ſhall I come and appeare before God. Pſal.</hi> 42.2. Therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God fill heaven and earth, yet is he ſaid to be in any place more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly where he gives more evident proofe of his preſence, as at Bethel, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.16. in the Tabernacle by the Oracle and thoſe manifeſt ſignes which I remembred above note <hi>(d)</hi> Thus God deſcended on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> when the Mountaine did ſmoke and tremble, and thus the holy Ghoſt is ſaid to have come upon the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary,</hi> when by that wonderful work of his in her body, that ſeed of mankind was taken of her, that it might become a tabernacle for the King of glory to dwel in eternally: Thus alſo our Lord ſaith of himſelf <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.38. <hi>I came downe from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, not to do mine own wil, but, &amp;c.</hi> not but that he was ſtil in heaven <hi>c.</hi> 3.13. but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his preſence in earth was now manifeſt in the fleſh, as it had not bin before.</p>
                           <p n="10">10. And theſe reaſons are, if not all, yet the moſt, I am ſure the beſt, which <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellus</hi> brings for his poſition. It may ſeeme fit moreover in this place to give anſwer to thoſe texts which beſide theſe already cited, may be brought for this opinion. And firſt to that which is <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.2, <hi>&amp;c. Yea, hath God ſaid yee ſhall not eat of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:107656:112"/>every tree of the Garden, &amp;c. yee ſhall not dye the death. But God doth know that In the day ye eate thereof your Eyes ſhall be opened.</hi> The word <hi>Elohim,</hi> God, here uſed, is of the plurall number, but God is one. And beſide it may bee thought that the devill durſt not have ſpoken thus of Chriſt his creator, if Hae had beene God bleſſed above all.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſw.</hi> The reaſon why Chriſt is every where in the Scripture called <hi>Elohim</hi> is, becauſe that being eternally the Sonne of God He alſo received of the Father power over all things, and was appointed to bee that man by whom the world ſhould be redeemed and judged. So the word <hi>Elohim</hi> though ſometimes given to Angels, ſometime to men, yet it abates nothing of the excellency of his being. To the reaſon I anſwer, that the devill never perſwades a man to ſinne, but firſt he corrupts his opinion concerning God. For hee that hath true and beſeeming thoughts of God, is not eaſily drawne to a wilfull ſinne. Therefore the devill doth here firſt perſwade the woman to diſtruſt the truth and goodneſſe of God, as being an enemy to him and his creature, man, as was ſaid before. <hi>chap.</hi> 22. But if the devill had in ſo many words affirmed that which <hi>Poſtellus</hi> doth, yet we know he is a lyar from the beginning and abode not in the truth.</p>
                           <p n="11">11. <hi>Gen</hi> 19.24. it is ſaid that the Lord rayned upon <hi>Sodome</hi> fire and brimſtone from the Lord: by which place though it may appeare that the Sonne is coeſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall with the Father, for both are named by the name of <hi>Iehova;</hi> yet the Father hath the excellency of honour before Him, and that he executes no Iudgement in the creature but by his fathers beheaſt: which is yet more evident by that which is <hi>Zach.</hi> 3.2. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Satan, The Lord rebuke thee O Satan;</hi> whereby it may ſeeme, either that there is not an equality of power in the Perſons of the Trinity, or elſe that there is a created Mediator, in whom the ſecond Perſon of the Trinity doth dwell.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſ.</hi> If the dignities of the deity be eſſential as was proved, then if there be one nature of the Father and the Sonne, it followes that their power and all other dignities are coequall. Onely the Father hath the prerogative of originall in this, that the Son is of the Father, but the Father is not of the Sonne, though he never were without the Sonne. And therefore thoſe profeſſions of our Lord, all power is given unto me both in heaven and in earth, <hi>Math.</hi> 28 18. And the Father hath committed all judgement to the Sonne <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.22. are firſt and above all to beare witneſſe to the truth, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18.37. For if he received his being originally from the Father then of neceſſity that power alſo which is eſſentiall unto him. Secondly, that as a Sonne he might honour His Father in the diſpenſation of that power, and execution of his Mediatorſhip. And thus hee deſtroyed <hi>Sodome</hi> by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Father, and thus he prayes that Satan may bee rebuked, and the faith of his diſciples confirmed, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.32.

That Chriſt is in the Father, and the Father in Him, theſe words being ſpoken in the Perſon of the Father, wil prove that Chriſt is the worker of al deliverances for his Church, both temporall, and eternall, and that he hath power to forgive ſins, and that the name or being of God is truely in Him. So by this Angell no created Mediator can be underſtood, for every ſin is a breach of the law of God againſt an infinite Iuſtice, which God alone and no creature can forgiue. And therefore that ſonne of man which had power on earth to forgive ſinne, muſt of neceſſity bee God and not a created Mediator. And although Iſrael were here threatned, that God would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from them for their Calfe; yet it is manifeſt. verſ. 17. that God at the prayer of <hi>Moſes</hi> pardoned their ſinne, and brought them into Canaan. But to take the objection as it may make moſt for this opinion, that God doth threaten to ſend a created Angel, yet theſe words <hi>My name is in him,</hi> cannot prove him to be this created Mediator, but rather that the Angell to be ſent, ſhould have a power de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legate, whereby to puniſh the rebellions of the people without ſparing, and that power was the power or name of God in him.</p>

The hereſies concerning the proprieties of the Mediator, are principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly three, of the 1. <hi>Acephali,</hi> the 2. <hi>Agnoetae,</hi> and the 3. <hi>Monothelites.</hi> The <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cephali</hi> or headleſſe, becauſe they had neither biſhops, nor prieſts, nor ſet times, nor order for the ſervice of God; though that as the two natures in Chriſt were confuſed (for from the <hi>Timotheans</hi> they deſcended) ſo alſo the proprieties of theſe natures. But if the firſt befals, as was ſhewed, §. 1.2, 3. before, then their confuſion, is alſo confounded. The author of this hereſie was one <hi>Severus</hi> a biſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> who dayly curſed the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> for that by their decree which you heard before, §. 1. they had foreſtalled this hereſie. But his blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous tongue cut out, and he baniſhed from his chayre, were worthy rewards of ſuch a Biſhop, <hi>Euag. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 4.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. From that hereſie of <hi>Apollinarius,</hi> came that of the <hi>Agnoetae;</hi> that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature of Chriſt was ignorant of many things, as the day of judgement, the grave of <hi>Lazarus</hi> &amp;c. For if the Godhead were changed into fleſh, as <hi>Apolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narius</hi> held; <hi>Themiſtius</hi> might well conclude, that both the being and alſo the proprieties of the Godhead muſt ſuffer loſſe thereby; and ſo falſly aſcribe unto the Godhead, that which was proper unto the manhood. But if the foundation were unſure, as it appeared. §. 2. their building muſt needs fall to the ground.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. And becauſe the opinion of <hi>Eutyches</hi> concerning the only divine nature in Chriſt, began to be hated: therfore <hi>Cyrus</hi> by ſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> upheld it by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of one will in Chriſt, for (ſaid he) the humane will of Chriſt either is none, or not at all moved as the will of man, but onely by God. But to take away thoſe proprieties which doe neceſſarily follow the nature and being of any thing, is to deſtroy the thing it ſelfe: ſo that to deny either the divine, or humane will of Chriſt, were to make him an unſufficient mediator; and is directly contrary to that ſcripture which is <hi>Luke.</hi> 22.42. <hi>Father, not my will, but thine be done.</hi>

                           <p n="4">4. From whence <hi>Iordanus Brunus</hi> a <hi>Neapolitan</hi> in my time in <hi>Oxford,</hi> would inforce a more wicked concluſion, That Chriſt was a ſinner, becauſe His will was not in every reſpect anſwerable to the will of God. And becauſe that which comes into the wicked imagination of one, may proove a ſtumbling blocke to another: I will by the way remove this out of the way. Therfore I anſwer. That becauſe man knowes not, nor may preſume to know what the ſecret will of God is, hee may in the freedome of his owne Will, will, deſire, pray for, and indeavor any thing which is not contrarie to the revealed will of God, and that without ſinne, eſpecially in ſuch things as ſtand with the naturall deſire of all the creature in the preſervation of it ſelfe in the preſent being which it hath. As a ſicke man without ſinne may uſe diet, medicine, and prayer for recovery; although God in His ſecret will have determined he ſhall dye. <hi>Davids</hi> purpoſe to build the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, though againſt the purpoſe of God, was ſo well accepted of God; as that he thereupon received the promiſe of a perpetuall ſucceſſion, even till Chriſt the eternall king to come of his ſeed, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.11. to 16. Nay, when <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had heard the ſentence of death from God Himſelfe, by the voice of his Prophet, <hi>Eſay</hi> 38. was his prayer, and his teares accounted finnefull, which God did ſo far accept, as that he confirmed his petition by a miracle? And although our Saviour knew himſelfe to have come into the world, that He ſhould dye for the ſinnes of the world: yet might he without ſinne pray unto His Father to ſave Him from
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:107656:114"/>that houre <hi>John</hi> 17.17. eſpecially divers figures affording that hope? was not <hi>Iſaak</hi> in the very ſtroake of death reſcued by the voice from heaven, when the <hi>Ram</hi> was offered up in his ſtead? <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. was not the ſcape goate <hi>Leu.</hi> 16.21.22. on which all the iniquities and ſinnes of the ſons of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were put, ſent away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live into the wilderneſſe?</p>
                           <p>But wherein was this repugnancy of his will to the will of God? <hi>Not my will, but thine be done.</hi> He denyed his owne will, he laid downe not onely his life, but even the deſire of life, that he might performe the will of his Father; ſo that the true concluſions which ariſe from hence or the like places are theſe; firſt, ſeing all men naturally deſire to live, and would not bee unclothed, that is, would not die 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4. but rather that our mortality might be ſwallowed up of life, as it ſhall be with them who are found alive at the comming of the Lord 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.51. and 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.15, 16, 17. Chriſt our Saviour was truly man both in the nature, and all the naturall properties of a man, contrarie to the hereſie of <hi>Eutyches,</hi> and the <hi>Monothelites,</hi> of which you may reade further (if you will) in <hi>Thom. Aquinas contra Gent. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 36. Secondly, and becauſe every pure and meerely natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall propertie is concreated with the thing whoſe property it is, and that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of life, is naturally in every thing which hath life, and that without ſinne, leſt he that put this deſire in the creature ſhould be ſuppoſed a cauſe of finne: it was no ſinne in our Saviour to deſire life upon that condition; contrary to the folly, and falſhood of <hi>Brunus.</hi> Thirdly, ſeeing that God the Father ſo loved the world, as that he refuſed to accept the prayer of his owne beloved Sonne, when hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought him with ſtrong crying and teares for life; but would give him to that moſt bitter death for us: what confidence and aſſurance of life may wee have, when the price of our redemption is paid, and hee our Redeemer reſtored unto life? for if while we were enemies, we were reconciled unto God by the death of his Sonne: how much more, being reconciled, ſhall we bee ſaved by his life? <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10.</p>

                        <p>Now when the fulneſſe of time came, that this promiſe of God ſhould bee fulfilled: the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> being ſanctified by the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> unto holineſſe of life, and puritie of affections: was ſo highly favoured and accepted of God, as that in her tender yeeres (for they write that ſhee was not above fourteene yeeres at the meſſage of the Angel) ſhee was vouchſafed worthy to bee the mother of the Saviour of the World. Her heart being therefore purified by the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> to beleeve the promiſe of God made to her by the Angel, and by him to bee perſwaded of the poſſibilitie thereof: Hee wrought in her alſo a free conſent thereto, a full ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the will of God, and a deſire of the performance of the promiſe. Reade <hi>Luke</hi> 1. from 28. to 39. Thus according to the nature of the Holy Spirit, ſhe firſt conceived her ſonne in her Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or underſtanding and holy deſires: then by the working of the Holy Spirit, that ſeed which is the originall of man-kinde was ſanctified, ſeparate and ſequeſtred into the place of naturall gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and the Eternall Son inveſted therein, that according to the time of life, Hee might bee borne the Son of man. O ſacred myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie! O miraculous conception! Yet thus muſt His conception be, who was to vnite all things in one. But for all this, is not Chriſt our Lord ſaid to bee the Son of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> although hee were thus conceived by Him; nor yet the Son of the holy Trinitie, as the <hi>Abiſsine</hi> Church confeſſeth. For as concerning His eternall being, Hee was the Son of the Father onely: ſo for this His man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beeing, Hee was the Son onely of His mother, having His hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature and birth of her, and conſequently His originall or diſcent from her Fathers, <hi>David, Abraham, &amp;c.</hi> And being then firſt conceived according to his humane nature, of which the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> was not partaker: therefore hee was not propagate of the ſubſtance of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> as <hi>Iſaac</hi> of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to kind, to which conception onely the name of Father and Son doth properlie belong. Now ſee the reaſons:</p>
                        <div type="section">
                           <head>That our Lord was conceived by the Holy-Ghost.</head>
                           <p>You may remember how it was ſaid in the Chapter before, § 10. <hi>Anſwere to the fourth objection,</hi> that the <hi>Holy-Ghost</hi> is that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite activitie, in whoſe ſtrength every thing doth worke. Which if it have truth in every naturall action (as I ſhewed) much more is it true in things above nature; ſuch as is this conception of our Lord.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. For if the fountaine bee corrupt; then alſo the water muſt bee unwholſome. And if original ſin doe follow every one that is conceived according to the fleſh, as it is ſaid <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. <hi>In ſin hath my mother conceived mee:</hi> then as it was neceſſarie that Hee which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:107656:115"/>ſhould bee a propitiation for the ſinne of others, ſhould bee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe holy, and vtterly ſeparate from ſinners: ſo was it alſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that his conception ſhould be onely by the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> that Hee might be free from all taint of ſinne, both originall and actuall.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. And as the generation according to the courſe of nature had beene in ſinne (as was ſhewed at large <hi>Chap.</hi> 17.) ſo alſo was it vtterly impoſſible that God thereby ſhould bee incarnate. For <hi>(b)</hi> no agent can worke beyond the power of its owne nature. But the Incarnation, whereby God and Man became one Perſon, was beyond the power of all naturall generation. For man, as all other naturall agents, is finite; the divine being infinite, and ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to bee begotten by man. Beſide this, the divine being in this caſe of being conceived, muſt have beene in the ſtate of a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer by a being finite. But theſe things are impoſſible. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was <hi>(c)</hi> neceſſary, that the conception ſhould bee by the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="3">3. If the conception of our Saviour had beene according to the courſe of naturall generation, then had there beene two fathers of one Perſon, and ſo the humanitie taken into the Deitie of (hriſt, had beene the cauſe of confuſion, in reſpect of the Father-hood, which had beene in God the Father, and in reſpect of man, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ſame Son. So the perfection of Father-hood had not beene wholly and perfectly in God the Father. So defect ſhould be in the firſt principle. But theſe things are inconvenient. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>(d)</hi> the conception was not by man.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. And why this conception was the peculiar worke of the <hi>Holy-Ghost,</hi> it may yet further appeare, thus. In all the workes of God in the creature, the whole Trinity works, either according to one man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner common to all the Perſons: or elſe according to their perſonall properties. Now in this incarnation of the Son, as the Father had begotten Him by eternall generation; ſo in the fulneſſe of time, did Hee ſend His Sonne into the world; and this ſending is that ſecond generation or begetting. For as the thought or intent in the minde of a man, is that inward word of his underſtanding, which being ſpoken, is made underſtandable by others: So the Word of God remaining eternally in the boſome of the Father, being ſent into the world, became manifeſt in the fleſh. And thus the whole being of Father-hood was in the Father, and of Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the Sonne. And beſides theſe two termes of begetting, belonging to the Father, and being begotten, belonging to the Sonne, there is onely that of conception neceſſary to this moſt wonderfull Incarnation, which muſt belong to the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> leaſt two offices being given to one Perſon, the third Perſon ſhould ceaſe to worke. So there ſhould bee inequalitie in their actions, and their workes without ſhould not bee conformable to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward beings, <hi>ſhewed Chap.</hi> 11. <hi>and</hi> 12. But this is not to bee affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: Therefore hee was conceived by the <hi>Holy-Ghost.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <pb n="4" facs="tcp:107656:116"/>
                           <p n="5">5. And ſeeing it was neceſſary that the Redeemer of the world ſhould be borne of a Virgin (as it will appeare in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter following) it was alſo neceſſary that the conception ſhould be by the <hi>Holy-Ghost.</hi> For as in the ordinary way of all generation, the female ſeed is not of ſtrength to become man, except it receive motion, life and ſtrength from the maſculine ſeed conveyed into the place of conception; which cannot be done but with the breach of Virginitie: ſo where the Virginitie was not impaired, it was neceſſary that the diſpoſing of the ſeed and enabling it unto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, ſhould bee by the power of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> who was able to ſupplie all defects in nature, and to cauſe the Virgin to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and conſequently to bring forth without the feeling either of pleaſure or paine.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. Every ſupernaturall worke which proceeds from the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Love, muſt bee performed by him who is the perfection of Love. But the Incarnation of God in man, was a ſupernaturall worke which proceeded from the ſuperabundant Love of God to Man-kind, <hi>See Chap.</hi> 22. <hi>Reaſons</hi> 4, 5.10, 11, 12. And therefore wrought by Him who is the perfit Love betweene the Father and the Sonne: that the perfection of the band, vnion, or knot of Love, might bee in the <hi>Holy-Ghost;</hi> as betweene the Perſons of the God-head, ſo betweene the God-head and the humanity.</p>

Then muſt it alſo follow, that Hee was ſubject to the ſinne; for no effect can bee, but by the precedence of the cauſe. But it is manifeſt that hee was ſubject unto moſt of theſe.

The ſinne was of <hi>Adam</hi> and his ſonnes, the puniſhment of CHRIST the Sonne of GOD. But the ſuppoſition that theſe defects (if they may bee ſo called) are the effects of originall ſinne, is falſe. For man being that creature in whom GOD would ſhew the ſuperexcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of His goodneſſe, wiſedome, glory, &amp;c. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 3.10.

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107656:116"/>wrought onely by the Devill in man, after the worke of God was perfect in him. And therefore our Lord did grow in wiſedome, and Stature like other men, as all the ſonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have done, though hee had never ſinned. And thus Chriſt tooke on him our infirmities, and that for this end, that Hee might beare our ſinne, that is, might ſet himſelfe in our ſtead to beare the puniſhment of our ſinnes, that by His ſtripes wee might bee healed.

Now although it bee plaine, that the heavens are impure in His ſight: that Hee found no ſtedfaſtneſſe in His Angels: that no creature could bee a Tabernacle worthy His dwelling, much leſſe the body of ſinfull man: Yet ſeeing that glorious fire was able to purifie and perfit whatſoever body that was, which He would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to take unto Himſelfe: therefore although for the reaſons in the Chapter following, it was meet, that Chriſt ſhould bee borne of a Virgin; yet not to take any holineſſe from her. For if it had ſeemed good vnto His wiſedome to take His man-hood from a corrupted <hi>Rahab,</hi> or a <hi>Tamar</hi> (as hee did onginally) yet was Hee able to ſanctifie and clenſe it, as He doth clenſe or take away the ſinnes of the world. And concerning that manly being which our Lord did take of the holy Virgin, though it were the moſt pure in all man-kind, though the vttermoſt puritie in all the creature, as being without the ſinne of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as I ſaid before: yet was it not of it ſelfe worthy to bee His pavillion, but became a dwelling worthy of His preſence onely, becauſe He, by that aſſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it unto himſelfe, did make it worthy of Himſelfe, as Hee ſaith <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.14. <hi>For their ſakes doe I ſanctifie my ſelfe:</hi> What is that? His Divine being is perfect holineſſe, and thereby did He ſanctifie His body, which was Himſelfe (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the wickedneſſe of <hi>Neſtorius</hi>) that that likewiſe might bee <hi>Holineſſe to the Lord,</hi> and a ſufficient ſacrifice, ſanctified by that offering of Himſelfe, for the ſinnes of the world. And this ſanctifying of that Tabernacle of His man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, was figured by the Cloud which filled the Tabernacle, <hi>Exod.</hi> 40.34.35. and the Temple, 1. <hi>Kings.</hi> 8.10.11. into which, ſeeing the Prieſts could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe of the Cloud: the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> ſignified, that when God ſhould dwell

And although it appeare by the manifeſt authoritie of the holy Scripture, that man was that ſpeciall creature of God, whereabout (to ſpeake as a man) Hee tooke moſt care: <hi>Let vs make man in our image: Gen.</hi> 1.26. <hi>Hee hath made vs, not wee our ſelues.

Thus alſo hath he diſgraced the noble Nation of the <hi>Hungars,</hi> beſide other particular perſons, among whom our <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Merlin.</hi> But beſide the generall truth of this rule, doth not common expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience ſhew, that different kinds bring out that which is neutrall, as the kindes of Horſes, and Aſſes, Mules? which ingender not to bring out their like, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe nature will not endure ſo great a diſgrace, as to have her kindes multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed contrary to kind. Moreover, ſeeing every thing brings forth the like, as a Man, a Man; a Lion, a Lion; Fire, Fire, &amp;c. What poſsibilitie is there that a ſpirit ſhould beget any thing but a ſpirit, as it appeares in the workes of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill in our fantaſies and affections, by which ſecondly hee may alſo cauſe vs to worke on that which is in our power, not in his. I know that in the vegetable, where much ſeed is hermaphroditicall, in planting, in grafting and the like, one kind may be bettered by another; but not in perfect animalls, much leſſe in man. I know alſo what poore ſhifts there bee to prove the poſsibilitie of theſe monſtrous generations, the fancy of <hi>Incubus</hi> and <hi>Succubus;</hi> and of the devill ſtealing the ſeed from a dead body, and ſuch like. But that pretious ſeed dyes inſtantly, except it be received into the proper veſſell. And when the body is once dead, and that ſoule gone which kept the whole, and every part and parcell of the body in life, that which was for a new life in another, muſt alſo die. I know that ſome both of the Fathers, and Schoole-men, are cited of a contrary opinion; but our learned King <hi>Damenob. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. vpon reaſons in nature unanſwereable, hath ſhewed the impoſsibilitie of this generation; to which I will adde one reaſon out of the Holy Scripture.

Now if <hi>Merlin,</hi> for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or the Nation of the <hi>Hungars</hi> were begotten by devills, then by that commandement were they alſo charged to honour the devill: which as no man under paine of Hell-fire may doe; ſo were it a damnable ſinne for any man to thinke that God hath commanded it. And yet this fancy would take ſtrength from <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 6.2, 4. where the ſonnes of God which <hi>Irenaeus lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 70. will have to bee Angels, accompanied with women; and ſo by that tranſgreſsion of kynds, Gyants were bred: <hi>See hereto Tertull: de virg: velandis.</hi> But thoſe <gap reason="foreign">

                              <hi>(c) Neceſſary that the conception ſhould be by the</hi> Holy-Ghoſt.] You ſee by theſe two reaſons, one taken from the humanity of Chriſt, the other from His Divinitie, that it was neceſſary that our Mediator in both reſpects, ſhould bee conceived of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt.</hi> They that have little time to thinke on natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Philoſophies, need ſome helpe to vnderſtand the difference of generation, and conception. And let us not bee afraid to ſpeake of the workes of God to His honour, according to trueth, and modeſtie. Generation or begetting, is actively in the Parents; for the female is alſo an agent in reſpect of the femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine ſeed which ſhee affords: generation paſsively, is in that which is begotten. Conception is an action or paſsion concurrent or neceſſary to generation. For although the ſeed on both ſides bee afforded; yet if it bee weake, and vnfit for generation, as in luſtfull perſons, or if it bee not retained, and duely nouriſhed in the wombe, there can bee no conception. Therefore in this wonderfull gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our Saviour, whereby he was made a naturall man, by naturall cauſes, as farre as they were incorrupted, there was alſo a conception neceſſary. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception actively was in the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> who prepared and fitted, firſt the minde of the Virgin (for if her actions or ſufferings herein had not beene voluntary, they had no way beene availeable unto her ſelfe for eternall life, then her body with all the powers and parts thereof, that ſhee might conceive, that is, both af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, retaine, and nouriſh that bleſſed tabernacle of Him that would dwell in us. The conception paſsively was either diſpoſitive, whereby the body of the Virgin was ſo fitted to conceive; or finall, whereby that which was concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, was perfected in every degree according to all the naturall cauſes neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thereto. And becauſe the <hi>Goly-Ghoſt</hi> was the chiefe agent, or worker in all this; therefore is the conception properly attributed unto Him.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>O the Infinite Wiſedome and Love of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in man, that there is no kind of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection poſſible to the creature, which hee hath not either manifeſted, or promiſed unto him. To frame and faſhion the body of <hi>Adam</hi> out of the earth, with His owne hands, to breath into him an immortall ſoule, was a wonderfull work, and one alone. Out of that virgin man to take a rib, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to make a woman, was a worke no leſſe wonderfull, and one alone. The ordinary propagation of man-kind is the third way for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe:
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:107656:118"/>becauſe Hee that was the Lord of all kindes here below, ſhould not be inferiour unto them in the poſſibility of bringing foorth his like. But that fourth and laſt way of mans generation, was that which out of the ſide of the virgin woman, brought out that man which ſhould reſtore and give perfection to all the reſt. More excellent than the third, which from corrupted and ſinfull parents, multiplies more corrupted and ſinfull children: more powerfull then the ſecond, which out of the more perfect ſex, brought out that which was leſſe perfect: more glorious and availeable to us then the firſt, which raiſed <hi>Adam</hi> out of duſt. For by this, God himſelfe to become one of us, tooke that which was ours, that he might give unto us, that which was His. And for the cleere proofe of this Article,</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>(a)</hi> That our Lord Chriſt was borne of a Virgin.</q>
                        <p n="1">1. Let this be one ground, which the holy Virgin her ſelfe did ſtand upon <hi>Luke</hi> 1.34. That without the ſociety of man, it is a thing in nature utterly impoſsible, that any generation of mankind can be. Secondly, That which is impoſſible to nature, becauſe the power whereby nature doth worke is a limited power; and in the perfect kinds of things according to one rule, is yet poſſible to God <hi>Luke</hi> 1.37. Thirdly, That the workes of God Himſelfe, the author of Nature, are more noble, excellent, and perfect then thoſe of nature. Whereupon it will follow reaſonably, that ſith our Saviour could be borne of a virgin, if He would, it was coveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſo to be; but He could, as it appeares by that which is ſaid; and alſo would, for ſo He declared it by His Prophet, <hi>Eſay</hi> 7.14. <hi>Behold a Virgin ſhall conceive and beare a Sonne.</hi> Therefore our Lord was borne of a virgin.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. All the fulnes of perfection ought to be in Him who was to reſtore man to that perfection which he had loſt. Therefore as <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Saviour had a Father in heaven without a mother, being begotten of the ſubſtance of His father, by an unconceiveable and moſt glorious generation: So ought He in earth without a father to have a mother, without any taint or ſpot, a Virgin.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. And ſeeing the Incarnation or Conception and Birth of the GOD of glory, was a grace and honour to mankind above all the creature; and a ſpeciall exaltation of her of whom Hee would be borne above all other women. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.28. if our Lord had not been conceived and borne of a moſt pure Virgin, then had He exalted the corrupted fleſh of mankind, and tainted with luſt, before that which was vncorrupt: which as in it ſelfe it had been inconvenient; ſo had it brought chaſtity and pureneſſe of life into contempt. But theſe things are inconvenient. Therefore it was neceſſary that the Saviour of the world ſhould be borne of a Virgin.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Neither was it beſeeming, neither was it poſſible, that the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:107656:118"/>Creator of all things ſhould become a creature, but after a peculiar and ſpeciall maner, the moſt honourable and beſeeming that could be. But neither could any conception be more honourable than by the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> nor any birth be more beſeeming than of a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin. Therefore ſo was He conceived, ſo borne.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. <hi>Adam</hi> was not deceived but the woman, yet a virgin being deceived, was vnto him the cauſe of tranſgreſſion. And leſt woman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind ſhould ever be ſubject to the rebuke of man for this, therefore was it neceſſary that the Saviour ſhould bee borne of a virgin. For if man had had any thing to doe in this generation of the Saviour, the woman had not ſo been quit from blame, in as much as man might have ſaid, That a woman could bring all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind into ſinne, but without man ſhee could afford no helpe, which inequality had not been meet betweene them that are equall heires of the ſame glorious hopes. Therefore that the healing might bee ſo made as was the wound, it was requiſite that Hee that takes away our ſinne, ſhould be borne of a virgin. And thus is that fulfilled which is ſpoken <hi>Ierem.</hi> 30.17. <hi>From thy wounds I will heale thee,</hi> that is, as thy wound was made, ſo ſhall thy health be procured.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. The virgin <hi>Eve</hi> was given to man for a helpe before him, yet ſhe brought him into ſinne, and the ſnares of the devill; but the purpoſe of God could not thereby be made void. Therefore that other virgine was ſhe that was eſpecially meant, who ſhould bring foorth that helpe of helpes in mans greateſt need. Therefore that face might anſwere to face, it was expedient that the Saviour of the world ſhould be borne of a virgin.</p>
                        <p n="7">7 And ſeeing he was conceived by the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> that no taint or luſt of ſinne might be in the conception: and that the ſubject of the action of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> ſhould be the moſt fit ſubject for ſuch a worke-maſter, and ſuch an action: and that a pure and uncorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted body was moſt fit for ſuch a conception. Therefore it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo neceſſary that he ſhould be borne of a virgin. For it cannot be ſuppoſed, that God who came into that harbour of His mothers body, that he might ſanctifie it, would at his going out, leave it in worſe eſtate than He had found it.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. One contrary cannot be an efficient cauſe of the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. As to ſay, That that which is pure and holy, ſhould be the cauſe of any impurity or corruption. But the conception which was the cauſe of this Birth was moſt pure, as having the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> the author thereof. Therefore could not the conception be any cauſe to take away the virginity of <hi>Chriſts</hi> mother. For ſo that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worke of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> ſhould have been ordained to an end more vnnoble then the worke; whereas the end is euer more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than thoſe things that are ordained for the end. So alſo He that commanded parents to be honoured, ſhould have brought a ſpot upon His owne mother, if by His birth her virginity had been
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:107656:119"/>impaired, which was not impaired by his conception. But theſe things are impoſſible. Therefore He was borne of a virgin.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. The birth of that child which is ſupernaturall, as being both God and man, muſt needs be moſt noble and ſupernaturall. But it could not be moſt noble, if it were with the diſpoyling of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers virginity, nor yet in the higheſt kind ſupernaturall, if it were not of a virgin. And this is that myſtery which all the Churches, ſtiled in <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.11. by the name of the daughters of <hi>Sion,</hi> are called to take knowledge of. <hi>Goe forth ô ye daughters of Sion, behold King Solomon, with the Crowne wherewith His mother crowned Him in the day of His eſpouſals, and in the day of the gladneſſe of His heart.</hi> And that becauſe all the myſteries of our ſalvation were accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in His humanity.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. Thus as God both by Himſelfe and by His Prophets hath ſhewed, that theſe things ſhould thus be fulfilled: So in the time appointed was Chriſt our Lord borne of a virgin. The holy au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities are, Firſt, that which is <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 3.15. <hi>The ſeed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhall bruiſe thy head,</hi> and if of the woman onely, as the promiſe ſtands, without any ayde or mention of man, then muſt the concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of neceſſity be by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> who ſhould give activity and working unto the female ſeed: and the birth being (as it beſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) anſwerable to the conception, muſt of neceſsity be of a virgin. Neither yet doth this abate any thing of the true and perfect hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of Chriſt, that He was made man onely of the female ſeed. For ſeeing every ſecond cauſe workes onely in the ſtrength of the firſt and chiefe cauſe; it is plaine, that whatſoever the ſecond cauſe is able to doe by the vertue of the firſt, that firſt is able to doe by it ſelfe. And therefore God who made man of the duſt of the earth, could alſo without any action of the manly ſeed, produce a perfect man of the ſeed of the Virgin, in which ſeed the whole hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity was, although it was not able to moove it ſelfe to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of kind. Another text is that of <hi>Eſay,</hi> cited before, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, a virgin ſhall conceive and beare a Sonne;</hi> and ſuch a birth could never be, but that the conception muſt be by the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt;</hi> And therefore it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord himſelfe ſhall give you a ſigne,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe He was the onely worker. That text of <hi>Ieremiah</hi> 31.22. <hi>The Lord hath created a new thing in the earth: A woman ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe a man:</hi> doth inforce as much as the former. But what new thing is this? Is any thing more uſuall then a woman with child? But this is the newneſſe, That a woman who never knew man, ſhould compaſſe <gap reason="foreign">

                                 <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> concerning the ſoule of Chriſt muſt heere bee ſifted a little neerer. <hi>Arius</hi> held that Chriſt tooke of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107656:120"/>Virgin the humane fleſh onely, and not the humane ſoule, but that the Word did ſupplie all the faculties of the ſoule in Him.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The <hi>Apollinariſts</hi> called alſo <hi>Dimaeritae,</hi> ſometime denied that Chriſt tooke any fleſh of the Virgin, but ſaid, that Hee was perfect man while hee was yet in heaven, before He was borne of the Virgin; and that that ſame body of His was equall and conſubſtantiall to the Divine Nature, becauſe He made it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Himſelfe of the Divine being: So that although He were borne of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin; yet was He in her body as in a place, not as one of the ſame nature with her. And theſe Hereticks though mungrells of <hi>Apollinarius,</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,</hi> yet <hi>Apollinarius</hi> was accounted their Syr.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Others among them, affirmed that Chriſt tooke a body of the Virgin, which was alſo enlived with a living, but not with a reaſonable ſoule. And hence had they their name <hi>Dimaritae,</hi> becauſe they gave theſe two third parts of the manly being unto Chriſt, but ſaid that a ſuperceleſtiall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding ſupplyed the want of the reaſonable ſoule. Theſe Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks were either moſt differing, or moſt uncertaine in their opinions, as you may find by <hi>Socrat. Eccleſ. hiſt. lib</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 36. So by <hi>Athanaſ. Epiſt. ad Epict. Epiſt. de Incarn. Dom.</hi> and <hi>orat. de Salut. adventu D. I. Chriſti,</hi> both againſt this opinion of <hi>Apollinaris:</hi> And becauſe both theſe opinions are againſt this Article, you ſhall firſt ſee the reaſons of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> againſt his firſt poſition: his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond errour ſhall goe in common with that of <hi>Arius.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="1">1. The firſt reaſon of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> is this. The Trinity onely is vncreated, but fleſh had the beginning of man. But <hi>Apollinarius</hi> might except by his owne poſitions; That the Sonne made His body conſubſtantiall to Himſelfe of the Divine being.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Whatſoever is ſubject to ſufferance, is created. But Chriſt ſuffered for us. Therefore by a created body. All is moſt true. Yet <hi>Apollinarius</hi> might except againe by his owne poſition. <hi>The Word became fleſh,</hi> and that <hi>Word</hi> was uncrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, therefore alſo that fleſh into which the <hi>Word</hi> was changed. But I looſe time to dally thus with theſe Hereticks. Therefore for full oppoſition to this he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie and the reſt recited before of <hi>Valentinus, Marcion, Apelles</hi> and their rabbles, conſider theſe reaſons which are brought, <hi>Chapter</hi> 20. to proove that the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator</hi> for the ſinne of man muſt bee man, and ſee how they accord with the Scriptures there cited. So alſo <hi>Galat.</hi> 4.4. and <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6, 7.</p>
                           <p>You may ſee the reaſons of <hi>Apollinarius</hi> for his opinions, in <hi>Epiphanius haereſ.</hi> 77. of which I thinke theſe are the beſt.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. A true manly body, is onely by the male-ſeed. But Chriſt was not ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. Therefore Hee had not a true manly, but a heavenly body.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſwere</hi> The propoſition is falſe. For <hi>Adam</hi> was not of manly ſeed, yet that true man, from whom all humane nature deſcended. Neither was our Lord leſſe perfect man becauſe hee was not ſo begotten; <hi>See the</hi> 10. <hi>reaſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="2">2. That which the Scripture hath pronounced ſinfull, may not bee given to Chriſt. But the fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. and ſo is ſinfull: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to bee given to Chriſt.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſwere.</hi> That text of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> is taken by a <hi>Metonymia.</hi> For the fleſh is not ſinfull, but the luſts that dwell in the fleſh are againſt the ſpirit, and ſinfull. But Chriſt tooke the creature, not the ſinne that dwelt therein.</p>
                           <p>Againſt the errors about the ſoule of Chriſt, whether that of <hi>Arius,</hi> or <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linarius,</hi> or them that had broached the opinion before their time, that Chriſt had not an humane ſoule, <hi>Ignat. Epiſt. ad Philadelph.</hi> you ſhall have the moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall reaſons out of <hi>Athanaſius Epiſt. de Incarn. D. I. C. contra Apoll.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="1">1. There were ſo many parts in Chriſt living, as He was reſolved into, when He was dead. But He was reſolved into two, the body which was buryed, and the ſoule which went downe to holl. Therefore there were two parts of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:107656:120"/>Chriſts humane being; a body, and a ſoule, which two together, doe make a whole and perfect man.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. If either the <hi>Word,</hi> or a ſuperceleſtiall underſtanding had beene in a ſence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe body, then could not that body have felt either paine without, or (much leſſe) inward griefe. But the ſoule of our Saviour was heavy unto death, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.38. Therefore Hee had a humane ſoule.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. A thing of one kind, cannot bee given as a fit ranſome for a thing of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind; but a body muſt bee given for the ranſome of a body, and a ſoule for the ranſome of a ſoule. Therefore that Chriſt might be a ſufficient Redeemer, it was neceſſary that He ſhould have both an humane body, and a humane ſoule.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. If either the created Deitie of <hi>Arius,</hi> or the ſuperceleſtiall ſpirit of <hi>Apolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narius</hi> had beene in Chriſt in ſtead of the humane ſoule, then could He not have given His ſoule for His ſheepe. But Hee was that Good Sepherd, which laid downe <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap> His owne ſoule, or life for His ſheepe; <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.11. Therefore He had a humane ſoule.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. If Chriſt had not had a ſoule, by the departure of which His body was dead; then had not He by His death deſtroyed him that had the power of death. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2.14. neither had he triumphed over death, by His reſurrection, neither had Hee beene a ſufficient ſacrifice and redemption for them that were dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes; and ſo had His comming beene in vaine. But all theſe things are impoſsible. Therefore Hee was in all things like His brethren, except their ſinnes. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2.17.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. If Chriſt had had either a life-leſſe body, or ſenſitive onely; and in ſtead of the humane ſoule, either a created deitie, or a ſuperceleſtiall ſpirit; then had He beene neither God nor man, and ſo an unmeet and inſufficient Redeemer of the world. For neither had ſuch a body beene perfect man, neither is a ſuperceleſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſpirit, nor a created deitie perfect God.</p>
                           <p>Yet had <hi>Apollinarius</hi> his reaſons, though hee erred from the truth; and by his reaſons, it ſeemes that he had moſt reverent thoughts of Chriſt. For thus he argues.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Mans ſoule is the ſeate of ſinne; of anger, concupiſcence, and the like. But theſe things could not be in Chriſt. Therefore neither the humane ſoule, in which onely they dwell.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſwere.</hi> Anger, ſorrow, compaſsion, ioy, and ſuch motions of the ſoule, are either ordinate, which are ſubject to Wiſedome, and the rules of the divine Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, expreſſed in the Law of God, and theſe were in Chriſt, and were not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. But the inordinate affections onely are ſinfull, and could not bee in Him which knew no ſinne.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Two perfect things in their perfection could not poſsibly become one. Therefore that the God-head with the man-hood might become one Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, it was neceſſary that the man-hood ſhould bee aſſumed imperfit; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Mediator had been two perſons.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſw.</hi> This argument was anſwered before, <hi>Note (g) Chapter</hi> 24. § 8. Yet in briefe, I ſay, that the word perfect, hath a two-fold meaning. For the God-head tooke the Man-hood unto Himſelfe perfect, that is; According to thoſe parts wherein the perfection of the Man-hood doth conſiſt, of Body and Soule. But as our Lord in His child-hood did grow in Age, Stature, Wiſedome, &amp;c. So before His birth did he grow from ſtate to ſtate, till the full time of naturall birth. And thus the Man-hood was aſſumed imperfect, that is, Not yet having attained unto that perfection whereto it was deſtinate, in the Birth; the Youth, the Manly age and ſtate. Therefore that feare of <hi>Apollinarius,</hi> of two perſons in Chriſt, was needleſſe. For beſide this that the Humane nature was both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and taken to the Divine in one inſtant, nothing in mankind can be called a perſon till it be living, and that it be <hi>per ſe ſola</hi> of it ſelfe, which ſeemes not
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:107656:121"/>to be before the birth. But this is without doubt, that that which is ſuſtained, or hath the being in another, can no way of it ſelfe be accounted a perſon. But it is manifeſt, that the Humanity of Chriſt is ſuſtained onely in His divinity. You know the received opinion touching the originall of the Soule.</p>
                           <p>§ 3. Though by all theſe heapes of Arguments, which you may read from <hi>Chapter</hi> 21. to this place; I have beaten out the braines of that beggerly Brat of <hi>Ebion,</hi> which affirmed that our Lord was begotten by <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of his wife <hi>Mary,</hi> as all other children; yet you may ſee, how the ſtinke of that carcaſe doth riſe vp againſt this Article, that He was borne of a Virgin; ſo dangerous a thing an hereſie is in matters of Faith. But for anſwere to thoſe reaſons that are brought hereto; you may reade the Note <hi>(g)</hi> §. 4. on the 24. Chapter before. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it bee proved by infallible arguments, that is to ſay, from authority of Holy Scripture, and reaſons drawne there-from, that our Lord Ieſus was both conceived, and borne of a Virgin, that Hee might be free from originall ſinne, whereto all the race of man-kind is ſubject, which are begotten and borne accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the common law of humane generation; yet would I not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in any thing which I haue ſaid thereto, to ſpeake contrary to that which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> hath, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.4. <hi>That marriage is honourable among all men, for whom it is neceſſary.</hi> But notwithſtanding the reaſons that Chriſt muſt be borne of a Virgins the mind will ſtill be asking, how He could bee truely man, and yet His mother a Virgin? Seeing wee have dereſted the hereſies of <hi>Valentine, Apel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> and all ſuch madneſſe. Whereto I anſwere. That the myſterie of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is, as the treaſure of the unſearchable riches; ſo of the manifold Wiſedome of God, into which the Angels deſire to looke, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.8.10. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. And therefore the pure and ſimple truth of God being delivered unto you, by His holy <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> and after, being made manifeſt by ſuch proofes as reaſon cannot except againſt; it may ſeeme an unreaſonable thing, yet further to require ſatisfaction for the poſsibilitie thereof. For to an infinite power, all things are poſsible. And as our Saviour was conceived, ſo alſo was Hee borne, and His mothers Virginitie ſaved; As He came to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> when the dores were ſhut, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 20.19.26. But (you ſay) His body was then changed and made Spirituall, He being raiſed from the dead, I confeſſe it. But yet that power by which He hid, or made Himſelfe inviſible, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.30. <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.59. and 12.36. by which He walked on the waters, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.14. by which He filled the world with wonders, and that before His body was raiſed from the dead. Beſide it is not unreaſonable for us to thinke that as the woman by whom ſinne was brought into the world, was brought out of the ſide of <hi>Adam:</hi> ſo that man by whom the ſatisfaction for our ſinne was made, might likewiſe bee brought out of the ſide of the Woman. For as it was ſufficient for our redemption, that our ranſome was paid in our whole and perfect nature, taken of the Virgin: ſo was it likewiſe more honourable, and beſeeming the Lord of Glory, having taken our fleſh, to be ſo borne. But <hi>Eve</hi> (you ſay) was ſo brought to being, while <hi>Adam</hi> was in a deepe ſleepe. I anſwer, that it is not utterly improbable that the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin likewiſe in that birth was faſt aſleepe. For firſt, it was in the night, the time of ſleepe. <hi>Luke</hi> 2.8. And it was according to all reaſon, that ſhee which had conceived without pleaſure, ſhould alſo bring forth without paine. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I affirme not this of any neceſsitie to bee beleeved; yet among thoſe many of whom you reade, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.1. which ſet forth the declaration of theſe things, that Goſpel which was ſaid to be written by Saint <hi>Bartholmew,</hi> affirmes this much. Howſoever, I thinke that <hi>Ierom</hi> ſpake too boldly, <hi>Dialog:</hi> 2. <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſus Pelag: Deum per genitalia virginis natum.</hi> Neither can I give my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to <hi>Tertullian, lib. de carne Chriſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And although the bleſſed Virgin at her Churching brought her offering commanded by the Law, to ſhew her thankefulneſſe and obedience; yet doth it not follow thereupon that ſhe was no virgin, as other women are or needed any purification for that birth, or that her Son was either borne or begotten as other children. But the virginity of the mother of God is impugned, not onely by theſe <hi>Ebionites,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by them that were called <hi>Antidicomarianitae,</hi> or <hi>Antimaritae,</hi> that is, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> of whom one <hi>Helvidius</hi> an vnletter'd fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, ſometime a ſcholler of the <hi>Arians,</hi> was ſaid to be chiefe, about the yeere 389. Now his opinion was, That after Chriſt was borne, <label type="milestone">

Though in the ſence of <hi>Helvidius</hi> this be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, <hi>Ioſeph</hi> being foureſcore yeeres old when he tooke her to wife, as <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> writes <hi>haereſ.</hi> 28. and that ſhe knowing how ſhe had conceived, vowed perpetuall virginity, her husband conſenting thereto, See <hi>Numb.</hi> 30.7. yet the argument is onely from the doubtfull ſignification of the word <hi>Knew,</hi> which in this place hath reference vnto the 18, and 19. verſes, where <hi>Ioſeph</hi> ſuſpecting her honeſty, thought to put her away; but not daring to doe that, being forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by the Angel, he tooke her, but yet knew not, that is, was not yet fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by his dreame that ſhe was with child by the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt.</hi> But when ſhe had brought forth her Sonne; then, By her miraculous deliverance, By the miracle toward the Shepherds, By the prophecie of <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Anna,</hi> By the comming of the Magicians from the Eaſt-countrey, By the admonition of the Angel to flee into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the ſlaughter of the <hi>Innocents</hi> that followed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he knew her to have bin with child by the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> and ſo to bee His mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that was the Saviour of the world. Others had rather anſwere from the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the word <hi>till, unto or untill,</hi> which with a negative, in the time to come, may ſignifie as much as <hi>never,</hi> as it is ſaid of <hi>Michal</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.23. <hi>That ſhe had no child till the day of her death;</hi> As on the other ſide, with an affirmative, it may ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie <hi>ever,</hi> as <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.20. <hi>I am with you alwayes unto, or untill the end of the world;</hi> not that he then forſakes them; for whom He loves, he loves unto the end, that is eternally.</p>
                           <p>Moreover, it is there ſaid, that ſhe brought foorth her firſt begotten Sonne, <label type="milestone">

But Chriſt is not called the firſt begotten of his mother, becauſe ſhe had other children after Him, but becauſe ſhe had none before him. So firſt begotten in this place, is as much, as only begotten. For as he was the only begotten of his father ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to His divine nature, becauſe he was the perfect Son of a perfect Father; So wa sit fit that He ſhould alſo be the onely Sonne of His mother, becauſe as Hee had in Himſelfe all the perfection of Sonſhip; So by His birth had Hee given to His mother the perfection of mother-hood above all women</p>

And although this Kingdome was to be a ſpirituall Kingdome of Grace and Glory, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.36. yet that is not firſt which is ſpirituall, but naturall; So that our Lord IESVS, according to the right of naturall deſcent by His mother, See <hi>Luke</hi> 3.5. <hi>ver.</hi> 24, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and of legall right by His father <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> See <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. was the true and lawfull King of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> as he is confeſſed by the <hi>Mags</hi> from the Eaſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. proclaimed by <hi>Pilate, Iohn</hi> 19.15, 19. and profeſſed by Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>Iohn</hi> 18.37. and that not by any reſerved and doubtfull meaning, but by a plaine and direct anſwere, according to the queſtion of <hi>Pilate, Art thou the King of the Iewes?</hi> For, for this cauſe was he borne, that He might beare witneſſe to the trueth. He therefore being both lawfull and naturall King of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to His deſcent from <hi>David,</hi> and that by an unqueſtionable right of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent, as the ſucceſsion of that Kingdome had ſtood from <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Iehoja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kim</hi> above 400. yeeres, and after the captivity, from <hi>Zorobabel</hi> to <hi>Ianna Hirca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> almoſt 300. yeeres, and that by the covenant of God Himſelfe to <hi>David,</hi> which was to be eſtabliſhed in Chriſt for ever; it muſt follow of neceſsity, that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> had no children by <hi>Mary</hi> his wife, as <hi>Helvidius</hi> barked. For ſo the right of that title to the Kingdome of <hi>David,</hi> ſhould have been to that heire who had the right by naturall deſcent from both parents, rather then to him which had right onely by His mother and adopted father. Neither had this which I plead, been good onely for <hi>Ioſephs</hi> ſonnes, but alſo for his daughters (if he had had any by <hi>Mary</hi> his wife) as it appeares in the caſe of the daughters of <hi>Zelophehad, Numb.</hi> 26.7, 8. Wherefore ſeeing it cannot be ſuppoſed but that the holy Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, bleſſed above other women, and freely beloved, ſhould not have bin denied the bleſsing of children, if ſhe had deſired any after her Son IESVS, it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of neceſsity, that for the eternity of <hi>Davids</hi> kingdome, to which our Lord had the only right, not by intruſion, or diſſannulling of a better title, I meane in civill right; He was that ſtone cut out without hands, that ſhall fill the whole earth, and that the bleſſed body of his mother, according to that viſion of <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel</hi> 44. was that Eaſt-gate, or ordinary way of entrance into mankind in which the Prince did ſit to grow before the Lord, as he that eares bread; even untill the time of His birth when He ſhould goe out thence perfect man. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had entred in by that gate, Therefore ſhoulod it be ſhut that no man might enter in by it, but that the holy Virgin ſhould conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue a virgin as in the conception, and birth; ſo for ever after a virgin. For neither had the outward Sanctuary of the Tabernacle, nor of the Temples afterward, any ſuch ſecluded gate, but that both Prieſts and People did go in and out there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, to doe their dayly ſervice. So then that myſticall Temple of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> muſt needs intend the Temple of the Virgins body, by which God Himſelfe entred into our Tabernacle, and came forth God-Man, bleſſed for ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>

                        <p>Now what theſe ſufferings were, it is in part manifeſt by the Prophets, and by the Evangeliſts Such was His poverty, as that He was borne in a ſtable among the beaſts; A manger was His Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:107656:123"/>of our Creed mentions only His ſufferings under <hi>Pontius Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi> under which all theſe by a Synecdoche, are comprehended; let us looke unto them in particular, for therein was the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Redemption.</p>
                        <p>But firſt, it may be heere demanded, why mention is made of <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> as if the trueth of God, and his moſt glorious worke in the creature, that is, the redemption of man by the death of His Son, ſhould any way need or admit of humane teſtimony. I anſwere, that as the Spirit of God in the Evangeliſts, vouchſafes to apply the hiſtory of the Goſpel, to the times of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> of <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Pilate</hi> his proconful, of <hi>Herod,</hi> of <hi>Philip,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 3.1, 2. ſo likewiſe this ſhort abridgment of the Goſpel, our Creed, doth not neglect them. For ſeeing the ſuffering of Chriſt was for the benefit of man-kind, it is neceſſary that wee ſhould bee made ſo ſure and certaine of the truth thereof, that howſoever that truth were tryed by divine, or by humane authority, of reaſon, or hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, it might moſt cleerely and plainely appeare. And therefore is this truth of Chriſt witneſſed, not onely by the Prophets, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts, as you read before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 24. <hi>Reaſon</hi> 10. and by the Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtories; but even the prophane writers, yea, the perſecutors and enemies of this truth, are not ſilent herein. <hi>Pilate</hi> himſelfe might bee a witneſſe of thoſe things which hee had heard and ſeene concerning the miracles, the death, and reſurrection of Chriſt, whereof hee writ unto <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Emperour. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it ſeemed not fit to the Wiſedome of God, that that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious truth concerning his Sonne, which Hee himſelfe had teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from heaven, and had confirmed by ſo many miracles and gifts of the <hi>Holy-Ghost,</hi> ſhould afterward receive authority from the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of <hi>Rome,</hi> that Senate, by whoſe authority ſo many thouſands of falſe gods were worſhipped, <hi>See Aug. de civ. D. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. yet even to that Senate, the trueth of his Deitie by that teſtimony of him that had heard and ſeene, was cleerely manifeſt, <hi>See Tertul. Apolog. cap.</hi> 5. <hi>Euſeb. Eccl. hiſt. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. And although <hi>Lucian,</hi> and <hi>Porphyrie,</hi> and <hi>Celſus,</hi> and ſuch doggs barked againſt the holy Religion of Chriſt; yet even therein they teſtified, that Chriſt did eſtabliſh a faith and Religion among His faithfull followers. <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni. Epiſt. lib.</hi> 10. <hi>Epist.</hi> 97. and <hi>Tacitus Annal. lib.</hi> 15. though they no <hi>Christians,</hi> for the firſt was a cruell perſecuter of them, yet have they teſtified ſo much, and have alwayes beene held faithfull in their writings: And ſo may <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> though hee make it que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable, whether Chriſt were onely a man, <hi>Antiq. lib.</hi> 18. <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. This therefore being without doubt, that our Lord did ſuffer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> it may bee further asked, why He being a <hi>Iewe</hi> ſhould bee condemned to die by the authoritie and power of the <hi>Romanes?</hi> For this there bee two reaſons principall, and chiefe: For the underſtanding of which, you need to remember that there have beene foure principall Monarchies in the earth; the firſt of the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:107656:124"/>
                           <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> and <hi>Babylonians,</hi> which tooke the beginning from <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi> of whom you reade, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.8, 9, 10. and was after encreaſed by <hi>Ninus, Semiramis, Salmanaſar, Bellochus,</hi> and others, but moſt of all by <hi>Nabuchadnezar.</hi> This Monarchy, after it had flouriſhed about ſeventeene hundred yeeres, was overthrowne by <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Median,</hi> and his nephew <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of <hi>Perſia;</hi> who were the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the ſecond Monarchie, which continued not much above 130. yeeres, and was then broken by <hi>Alexander,</hi> who in battell o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrew the laſt King <hi>Codoman.</hi> This <hi>Alexander</hi> began the third Monarchy of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> which after him was divided among his Captaines, of which foure were chiefe, <hi>See Dan. Cap.</hi> 8. of theſe foure Kingdomes, <hi>Egypt, Syria, Greece,</hi> and <hi>Aſia; Aſia</hi> continued but two deſcents of 23. yeeres; the other three one after another, were ſubdued by the <hi>Romanes,</hi> who made the fourth Monarchie. <hi>Syria,</hi> and by and by <hi>Iudea</hi> was ſubdued by <hi>Pompey,</hi> and made a Province of the <hi>Romans,</hi> about 60. yeeres before the birth of Chriſt. This <hi>Syria</hi> is a Countrey wide and large. <hi>Paleſtina</hi> inhabited by the twelve Tribes, a ſmall part therof. <hi>See Ptolom. Geogr. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 14. and <hi>Aſiae tab.</hi> 4. This Countrey in the time of Chriſt, was divided into three parts, or ſhires, <hi>Iudea</hi> toward the South, <hi>Galile</hi> to the North, and <hi>Samaria</hi> betweene them. <hi>Iohn,</hi> 4. v. 3, 4. Theſe <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanes</hi> were ſtrangers in the land, ſent thither onely to till the ground, after <hi>Salmanaſſar</hi> had carryed away the ten Tribes in the dayes of <hi>Hoſhea,</hi> 2. <hi>King.</hi> 18. from the 9. to the 13. verſe, <hi>Iudea</hi> and <hi>Galilee</hi> were poſſeſt by the <hi>Iewes,</hi> after their returne from <hi>Babylon.</hi> But after they were ſubdued by the <hi>Romanes,</hi> they were compelled t accept of ſuch government, as they appointed. Theſe <hi>Romanes,</hi> for the good ſervices and deſerts of <hi>Antipater</hi> Prince of the <hi>Idume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and of <hi>Herod</hi> his ſonne after him, gave the Kingdome over the <hi>Iewes,</hi> to that <hi>Herod</hi> ſurnamed the great, who held it 37. yeeres. <hi>Auguſtus</hi> beſide the gift of the Senate, enlarged the Kingdome of <hi>Herod,</hi> with the Countreys of <hi>Batanea, Trachonitis, Abylene,</hi> and others. But the <hi>Iewes</hi> knowing the time of <hi>Meſsiah</hi> to be at hand, whoſe Kingdome they thought ſhould be of this World, moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately refuſed the government of <hi>Herod</hi> a ſtranger: And though he ſought the eſtabliſhment of a juſt government over them, and did many things to their content; yet when hee ſaw that by no faire meanes hee could win them to accept his government, hee fill'd all places with crueltie and blood, till in the 31. yeere of his Reigne, they were compelled to acknowledge obedience to him as their King; and to his poſterity after him. So when the Scepter was vtterly departed from <hi>Iuda,</hi> even by their owne conſent; then according to the propheſie of <hi>Iacob,</hi> in the 32. of <hi>Herod,</hi> was the Angel ſent to the holy Virgin, when the <hi>Iewes</hi> had thus beene taught to know, that the true <hi>Meſsiah</hi> was to bring a greater deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, not to them onely, but to all man-kind, than any could be from an earthly bondage. So in the beginning of the 33. yeere of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:107656:124"/>
                           <hi>Herods</hi> reigne, was Ieſus borne. After ſixe yeeres lawfull reigne, <hi>Herod</hi> died miſerably: After whom, his Kingdome by <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was divided to his foure ſonnes, of their number called <hi>Tetrarchs:</hi> ſo that <hi>Archelaus</hi> had <hi>Idumea, Iudea,</hi> and <hi>Samaria; Herod</hi> called <hi>Antipas</hi> had <hi>Galilee; Philip</hi> had <hi>Iturea,</hi> and <hi>Trachonitis:</hi> And <hi>Lyſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> had <hi>Abylene.</hi> But <hi>Archelaus</hi> for his wicked government being by <hi>Auguſtuss</hi> thruſt from his dignitie, and baniſhed in <hi>Gallia, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> Preſidents, <hi>Coponius, Ambivius,</hi> and <hi>Rufus,</hi> were ſent thither to order that <hi>Tetrarchy,</hi> each two yeeres under <hi>Augustus.</hi> Then by the appointment of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> the ſucceeding Emperour, <hi>Valerius Gracus</hi> held that government 11. yeeres, and after him <hi>Pontius Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late;</hi> the other ſonnes of <hi>Herod</hi> ſtill holding their dignitie, as you reade, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.1.</p>
                        <div type="section">
                           <head>Now to the arguments.</head>
                           <p>Such was the mercy of God to man, that although the Goſpel which was preached in Paradiſe ought to have beene that chiefe thing which man ſhould remember; yet becauſe his way was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and he become abominable by his crueltie in the earth, his whole race, except eight perſons, were ſwept away by the flood. This great Iudgement might have taught all poſterities to know what that was which God required of men, and to deſire the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of that promiſe of Him that was to come. But this being neglected of all men, except ſome few among the leaſt of all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which God had choſen for his people, and they now in capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie in <hi>Babylon;</hi> God did againe call vpon the World, to turne unto Him, becauſe His Kingdome is an everlaſting Kingdome, and deliverance and ſalvation is by him alone. <hi>Read Dan. Chap.</hi> 2. v. 44. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. v. 29. and the Kings Proclamation at large, in the 4. <hi>Chapter.</hi> Not long after, the World was ſummoned againe by the like Preaching, and Proclamation of <hi>Darius</hi> in the ſecond Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy of the <hi>Medes. Dan.</hi> 6.25. and later hiſtories teſtifie abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, how <hi>Alexander</hi> marching with fury againſt <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> at the ſight of <hi>Iaddua</hi> the High-prieſt (as <hi>Paul</hi> before <hi>Danaſcus</hi>) of an Enemie, became a Convert, adored the Prieſt, ſacrificed, and offered gifts unto the true God. His ſucceſſors ſonne in <hi>Egypt Philadelphus,</hi> had the old Teſtament tranſlated into <hi>Greeke,</hi> and not long after, <hi>Ionathan Ben Vziel,</hi> tranſlated it in <hi>Chalde,</hi> that all the world might be prepared to receive that Saviour, that was ſhortly after to bee manifeſted, in that time when the greateſt and moſt powerfull Empire did flouriſh moſt, that is, in the dayes of <hi>Augustus,</hi> and his Succeſſor <hi>Tiberius.</hi> The argument in briefe is this.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. That ſeeing the ſatisfaction for the ſinne of man was to bee made by the death of Chriſt, beleeved on in the world: it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that as in every age, and Empire of the world, Hee had
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:107656:125"/>beene preached; So He ſhould die by the power of the greateſt Empire then in the worlde, that all the world might take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof. Therefore in the greateſt and moſt ſolemne feaſt of the <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> whither the <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Proſelytes</hi> from all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys reſorted (for He was firſt to be preached to them; <hi>Luke</hi> 24.47) and by the deputy of the greateſt Emperor, was this thing done and after publiſhed in that Senate, which ruled all; that as the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation was wrought for all, ſo all might know it. For by this meanes the preaching of His Apoſtles and Miniſters afterward was more eaſilie beleeved, that He was the Saviour of the world, whom after ſo much good done, and ſo great miracles ſhewed by Him, they did unjuſtly cauſe to die, when they found no cauſe of death in Him.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 The ſecond argument is this. The holy Scripture is the declaration of the will of God: Therefore it is neceſſary, that as all the will of God; ſo the holy Scriptures alſo bee fulfilled. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theſe, that of <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.10. is directly to this purpoſe, <hi>The Scepter ſhall not depart from Iudah, &amp;c. till Shiloh come.</hi> This <hi>Shiloh</hi> all the beſt Interpreters, both <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Christians</hi> agree, to bee Chriſt the King; from whence it followes neceſſarily, that when Chriſt came, the Scepter or authority had departed; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the <hi>Meſsiah</hi> being to bee ſlaine, the execution of that death muſt be by that forraine authority that ruled over them. And this the <hi>Iewes</hi> themſelves profeſſed, <hi>Iohn</hi> 18.31. <hi>It is not lawfull for us to put any man to death;</hi> you may put hereto, <hi>Eſay.</hi> 7.16. with thoſe texts cited in the 24. <hi>Chapter, Reaſon</hi> 10.</p>
                           <p>But you may object, that in the captivity, that Scepter was ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly broken; yea ſo, that after their returne they had no Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, but by the appointment of the Kings of <hi>Perſia,</hi> as it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by the Bookes of <hi>Ezra,</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Chapter</hi> 9. <hi>verſ.</hi> 36.37.</p>

                              <hi>I anſwere.</hi> That as the <hi>Iewes</hi> in that captivity, knew the time of their returne by the Prophet, <hi>Iere.</hi> 29.10. ſo they ever held the hope of their libertie from that ſubjection; and therefore after <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi> defended it againſt his ſucceſſors in <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Egypt;</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially when they had the favour and countenance of the <hi>Romans, See</hi> 1. of <hi>March. Chap.</hi> 15. <hi>verſe</hi> 16. and <hi>Iust. Hiſt. lib.</hi> 36. But in their ſubjection to <hi>Herod,</hi> they gave the government of themſelves and their poſterity unto him and his. And although <hi>Archelaus</hi> his ſonne, for hismiſ-government loſt it, yet it returned to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi> of whom hee received it; and therfore in this caſe betweene Chriſt, and <hi>Caeſar;</hi> they vtterly diſclaime Chriſt for their King, and profeſſe, they have no King but <hi>Caeſar, Iohn</hi> 19.5.</p>
                           <p>So then it being cleere, that our Lord was to ſuffer under the Lieutenant of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which at that time was <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> let us ſee what He ſuffered under him.</p>
                           <p>It is not likely that a Prophet having beene condemned by the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:107656:125"/>Eccleſiaſticall Iuriſdiction, and ſuffering moſt unjuſtly, ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches as you heard before, ſhould be better intreated before a civill Magiſtrate. Yet <hi>Pilate</hi> hath more patience to examine the cauſe. <hi>What accuſation bring ye againſt him?</hi> The points of His ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation were three. Firſt, <hi>He is a malefactor.</hi> How prooue you that? <hi>If He were not ſo, wee would not have delivered Him unto thee: Iohn</hi> 18.30. A very ſubſtantiall proofe, we malicious lyars ſay ſo, therefore it is ſo. The ſecond point, <hi>He is a blaſphemer,</hi> for Hee ſaid, <hi>I am the Sonne of God. Iohn</hi> 19.7. Hee ſaid true, and prooved it. <hi>Mark.</hi> 2. <hi>verſe</hi> 7. <hi>and</hi> 10. <hi>and Iohn</hi> 10. <hi>verſe</hi> 35, 36, 37, 38. Thirdly, <hi>Treaſon! He makes Himſelfe a King:</hi> He ſpeakes againſt <hi>Caeſar —calcemus Caeſaris hoſtem. Iohn</hi> 19.12. But He explained Himſelfe, <hi>That His Kingdome was not of this world. Iohn</hi> 18.36. And by the rule of your owne teachers, <hi>All they ſhall bee cut off that watch for iniquity, That make a man an offendor for a word, and lay a ſnare for him that reprooveth openly. Eſay</hi> 29.20, 21. So that for theſe crimes falſely objected, He was three times pronounced, Not guilty. <hi>I find no fault at all in Him. Iohn</hi> 18.38. <hi>and</hi> 19.4. <hi>and</hi> 6. No, nor yet <hi>Herod. Luke</hi> 23.15. and therefore, <hi>I will bee free of the blood of this juſt man, and waſh't his hands. Matth.</hi> 27.24. And was He innocent and juſt? moſt vnjuſt and wicked Iudge! ought not a Iudge aſwell to defend and deliver the innocent, as to puniſh the wicked? If He be innocent, Why doeſt thou, moſt unrighteous Iudge, betray the innocent to the power of His accuſers? <hi>Take yee Him, and iudge Him after your owne Law. Iohn</hi> 18.31. If He be innocent, Why doeſt thou torture Him with ſcourges and thornes, and the mockery of a purple robe? <hi>Iohn</hi> 19.1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Why doeſt thou deliver Him to the will of His enemies? <hi>Luke</hi> 23.35. Thus the wicked play in the credit and welfare of the righteous, and account it no ſinne, if they can have any pretext to ſay they are innocent. Thus our Lord was denyed His right to His Kingdome, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.14. betrayed by His rebellious Subjects: His life was ſet at nought, to ſave a murderer, vnjuſtly accuſed; ſtript of His clothing; And beſide all this of loſſe which He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured; He ſuffered all that paine and puniſhment which they could bring upon Him. As firſt, His baſe and ſcornefull appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, as of a thiefe in the night. 2. His being hurried from place to place, from Iudge to Iudge. 3. The moſt unjuſt ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Blaſphemy, of Treaſon, of Death. 4. His Buffeting, Mocking, Whipping, Crowning, with all kind of contempt and ſcorne: and 5. That by a moſt unjuſt Iudge, who ſtill profeſt Him innocent, He was betrayed to the will of His adverſaries to be Crucified. 6. And yet, becauſe nothing could glut the gorges of thoſe bloody Prieſts, in the agonyes of death, behold a freſh on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet of Scorne and Reviling. <hi>Matth.</hi> 27, 41. 7. Neither will the abjects be left out, with their Gall and Vinegar. 8. No, nor yet the theeves in the ſame condemnation with their upbraidings.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:107656:126"/>O man of ſorrowes, and contradiction! <hi>Behold and ſee, all you that paſſe by, if there were ever any ſorrow</hi> like unto that which was done unto Him, wherewith the Lord afflicted Him in the day of His fierce anger. Yet were all theſe things but ſmall afflictions, in compariſon of this; that God had withdrawne the light of His comforts from Him. For this cauſe alone were His roarings pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out. <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?</hi> Yet may it not be thought but that He was ſtill one with the Perſon of the God-head; and that not onely in His agony on the Croſſe, but in death alſo; when His ſoule was parted from the body; So that although there was a diſſolution in nature, of the Soule and the Body; yet the unity of the Man-hood with the God-head, was ſtill ſaved in the Perſon of the God-head. <hi>See Acts</hi> 2.27.</p>
                           <p>But although this acte of <hi>Pilate</hi> in himſelfe was moſt unjuſt: yet in God the Father; whoſe Perſon <hi>Pilate,</hi> in that iudgement did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent, the act was moſt righteous and juſt. That <hi>Pilate</hi> in his Iudgement repreſented God the Father, it is manifeſt not onely by this, <hi>That all power is of God; Rom.</hi> 13.1. but even in this very caſe, by that which our Saviour anſwered unto <hi>Pilate: Thou couldeſt have no power at all againſt mee, except it were given thee from above. Iohn</hi> 19.11. In this act therefore of <hi>Pilate,</hi> God did ſummon and judge the whole world to anſwere for their ſinnes: And becauſe euery mouth was ſtopped, and the whole world was found ſubject to the judgement and wrath of God, for their ſinne; therefore was it neceſſary, that the condemnation and puniſhment ſhould fall on Him to the full, that had ſet Himſelfe to anſwere for us, leſt no fleſh ſhould be ſaved. So through His ſufferings, as we were condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Him, by Him are we alſo ſaved. But it comes now to be enquired, Why our Sauiour ſhould be condemned to a death, ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous, as to be</p>

                           <p>THere were foure kinds of death appointed for Malefactors by the Law of God; Stoning, Burning, the Sword, Hanging by the necke. The particular offences you may finde gathered from the Hebrew Doctors by <hi>Henry Ainſw:</hi> on <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.12. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Hanging, amongſt all thoſe, was accounted the moſt eaſie death, yet on that kind of death was the curſe pronounced, as you ſee, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.22. But if they that committed the leaſt ſinnes, and therefore ſuffred the moſt eaſie death, were accurſed, as the adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, &amp;c. how much more they which ſinned in higher degrees and were judged worthy of greater puniſhment? This kind of death, by nailing to a Croſſe, more cruell then any appointed by the Law of God, was in common uſe among the <hi>Romanes,</hi> after their firſt Kings, eſpecially for their ſlaves. <hi>See M. T. Cic: orat pro Rab: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duell:</hi>
                              <pb n="25" facs="tcp:107656:126"/>and <hi>Lipſ: de Cruce. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. over whom every Lord had power, and vſed to crucifie them for theft, and eſpecially for running away. After, it grew in uſe for the baſer ſort of male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors though free-men, as theeues and ſuch like, and for their provincialls. And when the lawleſſe power of the Emperours had made all ſlaues, then they that called themſelues Free-men and Citizens of <hi>Rome,</hi> were alſo crucified at the will of the Emperours, as you may ſee <hi>Lips: de Cruce. lib. cap.</hi> 15. <hi>et lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c. p.</hi> 7. But although this kinde of nayling on the tree by which our Lord did dye, was not in uſe among the <hi>Iewes,</hi> as <hi>Lip. de Cruce. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. ſuppoſes; unduly confounding the ſtaking, ſtrangling on a Gibbet, or bough, and nayling on a <hi>Croſſe;</hi> yet by the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of S. <hi>Paul Gal.</hi> 3 13. did the curſe directly belong to this ſuffering of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> wherein He was made a Curſe for vs. Now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe reaſons, why our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſhould dye by this moſt vile and infamous death of the <hi>Croſſe;</hi> The firſt ſhall bee even from thence, becauſe it was moſt baſe and ſhamefull. For ſeeing man-kind by his ſinne, had forſaken God his juſt and lawfull Lord, and made himſelfe a ſlaue to the Divell; what manner of death, but the moſt vile and ſhamefull could He be judged worthy of, that had ſo falſly and baſely tranſgreſſed? And therefore was it neceſſary, that He who had made Himſelfe mans ſurety, and put Himſelfe in his ſtead, to beare his puniſhment, ſhould alſo die by the moſt infamous death of the Croſſe, the puniſhment of ſlaves that had run away from their Lords.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. It is fit and neceſſary that the Sonne of God ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted to the higheſt degree of glory. The greateſt glory is not due but to the greateſt humility. The loweſt degree of humility that can be, is to be ſubject to the moſt ſhamefull death. Therefore that our Lord the Sonne of God might be exalted to the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of glory, it was neceſſary that He ſhould firſt be abaſed to the death of the Croſſe. Neither is this an argument of amplification but founded in the rules of the infinite Iuſtice, and therefore urged by Saint <hi>Paul. Philip.</hi> 2. <hi>verſe</hi> 8, 9, 10. <hi>He humbled Himſelfe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſſe. Therefore God hath exalted Him, and given Him the Name which is above every Name, that every tongue ſhould confeſſe that Chriſt is Iehova.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="3">3. And ſeeing He ſuffered under the power of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> it was neceſſary that He ſhould die by that manner of death which was moſt uſuall with the <hi>Romanes,</hi> which for their ſeruants and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincialls, was the Croſſe. And although it ſeemed unto <hi>Pilate</hi> himſelfe an unworthy death for Him, <hi>Shall I crucifie your King?</hi> Yet nothing could content His enemies, but <hi>Crucifie Him, Crucifie Him.</hi> And becauſe our Lord had no ſuch priuiledge to plead for Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that He was a free man of <hi>Rome,</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did. <hi>Act.</hi> 16.37. &amp; 22.25, 29. &amp; 25.11. and ſo loſt his head by the ſword: Therefore He muſt needs endure that bitter, and accurſed death of the Croſſe.</p>

                           <p n="4">4. The tree through the craft of the devill was unto man-kind a cauſe of ſinne. Therefore leſt the tree which was created good, might become a curſe to him for whom it was created, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the end of the creation might be perverted, it ſeemed fit to the Wiſedome of God, that as the tree had beene an inſtrument in the worke of mans condemnation, it ſhould alſo bee an inſtrument in the worke of his redemption, that man by his wound might alſo bee healed. And therefore that our ranſome ſhould bee payed on the Croſſe.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Man by his ſinne had made himſelfe ſubject to the curſe of the Law. Therefore that the promiſe to <hi>Abraham, That in his ſeed all the Nations of the earth ſhould bee bleſſed, Gen.</hi> 12.3. might come vpon them, it was neceſſary that the curſe ſhould fall vpon that promiſed ſeed, in whom they were to bee bleſſed, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth argue, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. and 14.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. This crucifying of our Lord was prefigured diverſlie in the Law, as by the Serpent in the Wilderneſſe; if you compare <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.8. with <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.14. <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo ſpreading out his hands in the forme of the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> overcame <hi>Amalec</hi> by his prayer, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.11. But aboue all other figures: that glorious Type of Chriſt, <hi>Samſon,</hi> who ſhould begin to ſave <hi>Iſrael, Iud</hi> 14.5. moſt liuely figured our Saviour on the <hi>Croſse,</hi> when he laid his hands upon the Pillars, and ſlew more at his death, than he had done in all his life, <hi>Iud.</hi> 16.30. So our Lord, the Authour and Finiſher of our Salvation, though by His Preaching and His miracles He had ſhaken the Kingdome of the Devill, yet by His death upon the <hi>Croſse</hi> He did triumph over all the power of hell, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 22.16. propheſies plainely of the wounds wherewith He was pierced in His hands, and His feet, when He was nailed to the Croſſe, as the Prophet <hi>Zechary, Chap.</hi> 12.10. of that wound which through His ſide they made in His heart. I <hi>(the Lord) will powre vpon the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Ieruſalem the Spirit of Grace, and ſupplication, and they ſhall looke upon mee whom they have pierced.</hi> And thus according to the Propheſies that were before, was our Saviour crucified, as you reade in the Goſpel.</p>

                           <p>VVEe ſee <hi>IESVS</hi> made a little lower then the Angels for the ſuffering of death, that He by the Grace of God ſhould taſte of death for every man. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. All the reaſons for His crucifying confirme thus much. And for this cauſe was Hee conceived and borne, that He might redeeme His people from their ſinnes. The arguments alſo of the 19. <hi>Chapter,</hi> of the 21.22. and 23. come all to this centre; that <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord, and onely Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, muſt die for our ſinne.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. For ſeeing man by his ſinne had made himſelfe ſubject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death, according to the juſt ſentence, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. <hi>In the day that thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die;</hi> it was neceſſary, that He that had made Himſelfe our ſurety, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. and taken our ſinne upon him, <hi>Eſay.</hi> 52. ſhould die for our ſinne.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. It was neceſſary that the higheſt degree of obedience, ſhould bee in him, in whom was alſo the perfection of Sonne-ſhip. But all the perfection of Son-ſhip was in <hi>Christ,</hi> both that which is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, and that which is in time, as hath appeared. Therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the perfection of obedience. But there can be no degree of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience beyond this, that a ſonne ſhould die at the will of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Therefore it was neceſſary, that our Lord ſhould die. <hi>For God ſo loved the world, that He gave his onely begotten Sonne to die: that the world by him might bee ſaved.</hi> But becauſe it was impoſſible that He in his Eternall being ſhould be ſubject to death, therfore was it neceſſary that He ſhould bee incarnate, that Hee ſhould bee conceived of the <hi>Holy-Ghost,</hi> and be borne of a Virgin, as it hath beene prooved.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. If <hi>Iſaac</hi> the ſhadow, were content to die at the will of His Father, how much more ought Chriſt the ſubſtance, to fulfill the will of His Father?</p>
                           <p n="4">4. The manifeſtation of the infinite dignities of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is the proper and peculiar office of the Son, <hi>See Iohn</hi> 17.6. and 26. And how could either the infinite Iuſtice, or Mercy, or Love of God the Father toward His creature; or His honour in the creature bee better manifeſted, than in the death of that Son? For although it were farre from Injuſtice to puniſh the innocent for the wicked, when He had ſet Himſelfe to anſwere for the ſinnes of the world; yet was it the uttermoſt, the moſt ſevere and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Iuſtice that poſſible could bee, to lay upon Him, in whom there was no ſinne, neither was there any guile found in His mouth, the burden of vs all; to breake him for our ſinnes; to multiplie His ſorrowes; and at once to deprive Him of all the comforts of God, and life it ſelfe for our offences. Neither could the Mercy or love of God toward His creature be greater than this, that when
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:107656:128"/>wee were enemies, yet ſpared He not His owne Sonne, to worke our reconciliation. Neither can the honour of God be more mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by the creature, than for that mercy and love, which he hath ſhewed toward the creature, in the Eternall Glory, and happineſſe which He hath reſerved for it, through the ſatisfaction of his Son. And becauſe theſe things could not poſſibly be brought to paſſe otherwayes than by the death of the Sonne of God, therefore was it neceſſary that He ſhould die.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Of contrary effects, the immediate cauſes muſt needs bee contrary: The greateſt delight and joy which the naturall man hath, is to follow his ſinfull luſts. Therefore the recovery, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring of man from his ſinfull ſtate, cannot bee but by the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the greateſt ſorrow, that is, of death.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. The obedience and ſufferings of Him who was to make ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for the diſobedience and rebellion of all man-kind, could not poſſibly be either exceeded or equalled. But if our Lord had not died a moſt bitter and cruell death, in thoſe torments which He endured, both in his ſoule and body, then had His ſufferings beene equalled, if not exceeded, by many of the holy Martyrs: who for their love and faith in God, endured moſt bitter and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite torments, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that with joy unſpeakable, and glorious. Therefore it was neceſſary, that our Saviour ſhould die a moſt cruell death, and bitter, both in the ſufferings of His ſoule, and body.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. The greateſt exaltation or glory that could come unto the creature, was in this, that it ſhould become one Perſon with the Creator, which we have proved before to have beene done in the incarnation. For the greateſt glory and grace done to the creature, the greateſt love, and humilitie is due to the Creator. But our Lord, who was ſo exalted, had not beene humbled to the loweſt degree of humilitie, if He had not died a moſt ſhamefull death. Therefore it was expedient that He ſhould ſo die.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. Full and perfect obedience, is due from man-kind, unto the Creator, and eſpecially from that Man of men, their Prince and Captaine, who ought to be an example unto them, of all thoſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues whereby they ought to glorifie His Father. Therefore that faithfull men might willingly die for the love and ſervice of God, it was neceſſary that our Lord ſhould give the example, <hi>See</hi> 1. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> 2.21.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. IT is ſaid that death is the uttermoſt or laſt of evills. And that wee might by all arguments bee aſſured of His death, by whoſe ſuffering of death, wee are ranſomed from the power of death; it was neceſſary that after His death, our Lord ſhould bee
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:107656:128"/>buried: Seeing that by His buriall we are aſſured, not only that He was truely dead; but alſo, that during the time of His buriall, He was held under the power of death.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The greateſt triumph cannot bee aſcribed but to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt victory manifeſt and knowne. The greateſt victory is over the greateſt enemy, Death, and him that had the power of death, the Devill. And that Chriſt might be acknowledged to have riſen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and ſo to have triumphed over death, it was neceſſary that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter His death, He ſhould be buried: Seeing many perſons in Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexies, Plagues, <hi>Singer</hi> in his drunkenneſſe; ſo after hanging, drowning, falls, and other both inward ſickneſſes and outward vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences have been ſuppoſed to have beene dead, which yet have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to life againe. But after buriall for ſo long time, no man ever returned to life, but by a power that was divine. Therefore that our Lord might truely be acknowledged to have riſen from the dead, and ſo to have triumphed over Death, it was neceſſary firſt that Hee ſhould be buried.</p>

                           <p n="2">2. The doctrine of <hi>Valentin</hi> is refuted at large by <hi>Irenaus, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 32. And that by the manifeſt authority of S. <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 4.4. where it is ſaid, That <hi>Chriſt was made of a woman.</hi> So alſo by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> in his Booke <hi>De carne Chriſti.</hi> The Evangeliſts <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> deſcribe His humane generation: Beſides His manly Paſsions approove Him to have had the true holy of a man, as to be Hungry, Thirſty, Weary, to Sweat, to Weepe, &amp;c. Moreover, if He had not ſuffered in the true and very Body of man, His ſuffering for us had been of none effect, for the ranſome of our bodies. Their Arguments you may ſee more at large in the Bookes cited. But <hi>Epiphanius; Haer.</hi> 1. layes not this Hereſie to the charge of <hi>Valentin,</hi> as the Authors forenamed; And S. <hi>Aug. haer. oap.</hi> 12. but rather puts it to <hi>Marcion, Haer.</hi> 42. who taught that the Incarnation of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was not in deed, but onely in ſhew; whom he refutes only by thoſe Scriptures which <hi>Marcion</hi> allowed of; as the Goſpel of S. <hi>Luke,</hi> which <hi>Marcion</hi> received (except that which concernes the Genealogie of <hi>Chriſt</hi>) and certaine Epiſtles of Saint <hi>Paul:</hi> For all the Olde Teſtament and the reſt of the New lie rejected. But in theſe Scriptures <hi>Chriſt</hi> calleth Himſelfe the Sonne of man. Hee was thronged by the multitude, He lift up His eyes, He prayed on His knees, His feet were anointed, He ſlept on the ſea. He is made of the ſeed of <hi>David</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.3. So that if, <hi>David</hi> had a true manly body, then alſo the body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was a true manly body. He gave up the ghoſt: His lifeleſſe body was taken from the Croſſe, wrapped in Linnen, and Buried. After His Reſurrection alſo He ſaid, <hi>Handle me, and ſee mee; for a Spirit hath not fleſh and bones, as ye ſee me have, Luke</hi> 24.39. And theſe Texts out of thoſe Scriptures only are ſufficient to reproove the falſhood of theſe Hereticks. And for full ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction heerein, you may take the interpretation of <hi>Tho. Aqu. cont. gent. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 30. to thoſe Texts of Scripture whence <hi>Valentin</hi> might ſeeme to have taken occaſion or his Hereſie. Firſt it is ſaid <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.13. <hi>No man hath aſcended up to heaven, but Hee that came downe from heaven, the Sonne of man which is in heaven. Anſwer.</hi> This comming downe from heaven cannot bee meant of His body, or of His ſoule, becauſe of that which followes, <hi>The Sonne of man which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi> for it is proper onely to the Godhead to fill both heaven and earth. <hi>Ier.</hi> 23.24. Therefore as God is ſaid to have come downe from heaven, not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, but in reſpect of His dwelling in the Manhood; So is the Sonne of man alſo ſaid to be in heaven, not properly, but in reſpect of the unity of His huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with the Godhead. According to this ſence Hee ſaid alſo, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.38. <hi>I came downe from heaven to doe the will of Him that ſent me,</hi> as you read before. <hi>Note (g)</hi> §. 10. <hi>ob.</hi> 9. <hi>on Chap.</hi> 24. Another Text which may ſeeme to make for <hi>Valentin</hi> is 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.47. <hi>The firſt man is of the earth, earthly: the ſecond man is the Lord from heaven:</hi> Yet this prooves not that the body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was not taken from His mother, but rather that as wee are ſtained with originall ſinne by <hi>Adam;</hi> ſo are wee waſhed and clenſed by the blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for ſo it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, <hi>Verſe</hi> 49. <hi>As we have borne the image of the earthly; we ſhall alſo beare the image of the heavenly.</hi> And although it be ſaid, <hi>The ſecond man is the Lord from heaven,</hi> yet prooves it not that He brought His body from heaven: but rather becauſe wee underſtand nothing of heavenly things, but by bodily likeneſſes: therefore is Hee called, the man <hi>from heaven,</hi> to ſignifie that new manner of being which God had with us in our nature, and to aſſure us that Hee our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer is our eternall God, able to ſave us; and man with us, that doeth pitie our miſeries.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. The Hereſies of <hi>Apelles</hi> are refuted by <hi>Epiphanius, Haer.</hi> 44. briefly, and plainely: but this which concernes the body of our Lord more fully by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> in his Booke <hi>De carne Chriſti.</hi> You ſhall have what I held fit to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:107656:129"/>gather from both, or to adde thereto. The arguments of <hi>Apelles</hi> are in part all one with thoſe of <hi>Valentin</hi> already anſwered; The reſt are theſe that follow.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. If the Angels appeared in fleſh not taken from mankinde, much more might <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But the firſt is true; therefore the later. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in the Propoſition is not good: For the Angels came not to die, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to be borne, as our Lord Hinſelfe appeared to <hi>Abraham</hi> not borne of a woman, becauſe the time appointed that He ſhould die was not yet. But when the fulneſſe of the time was come, that He by His death ſhould take away the ſinnes of the world, then God ſent His Sonne made of a woman. Beſides this, they are beſide the queſtion. For to proove their Pofition, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> tooke His body of the Starres and Elements, they ought to proove that the Angels alſo tooke ſuch bodies. But that they cannot proove. For if the Angels made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that which by nature they were not, why might they not doe it by that which was not?</p>
                           <p n="2">2. It is ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.48. <hi>Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?</hi> If then <hi>Chriſt</hi> had no mother or brethren but in that ſpirituall kindred of them which kept the word of God, He had no body taken of the Virgin. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> No man would have told Him that His mother ſtood without, which did not know that ſnee was His mother. Therefore the circumſtances and time of His ſpeech muſt be obſerved. He was now in the buſineſſe of God His Father, for whom all earthly parents muſt be denied, as He alſo anſwered, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.49.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. But the fleſh of ſinfull man was an unfit and unworthy dwelling for Him that came to deſtroy the workes of the devill. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> As ſinne, the worke of the devill, was brought into mankinde by the body, and the bodily ſences, as it appeares, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.6. <hi>The woman ſeeing that the fruit was good for food, and pleaſant to ſight, tooke and did eat it:</hi> So was it neceſſary that ſinne ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed in the body of that fleſh wherein ſinne was conceived and wrought. Moreover the difference not of the matter which muſt be one, but of the Spirit of ſanctification which was in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> made His body a fit ſacrifice for ſinne. But concerning this unworthineſſe alleadged, anſwere was made before, <hi>Note (a) ob.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. <hi>on Chap.</hi> 25.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. But if He had fleſh like ours, Hee ſhould have beene begotten like us. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The conſequence is not good, as was ſhewed before, <hi>Note (a)</hi> §. 2. <hi>on Chap.</hi> 26.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. If the fleſh of <hi>Chriſt</hi> were the ſame with ours, the common accidents of both ſhould be alike, ſo that our fleſh ſhould forthwith riſe againe like His; or His like ours bee reſolved to duſt. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> When our Lord had fully ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Iuſtice of God for the ſinne of mankinde, it had beene agianſt Iuſtice that He which had done no ſinne ſhould have ſtill continued under the power of death; and therefore impoſsible, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.24. But our bodies doe therefore ſtill reſt in hope, becauſe all His enemies are not ſubjected unto Him, among which the laſt is death, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.26.</p>
                           <p>Therefore for concluſion of this point, over and above thoſe reaſons which you had in the twentieth Chapter, and the authorities in the end of the three and twentieth Chapter, and theſe which are heere already cited, take that of <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.30. <hi>We are members of His body, of His fleſh, and of His bones.</hi> So that if we know or beleeve that we our ſelves have a body of fleſh and bones, we muſt alſo know that our Lord had a true naturall and humane body, as one of us. Which authority is yet of ſo much the greater regard, becauſe it was prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied in Paradice, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.22. That our Redeemer ſhould be incarnate; that in the body of His fleſh, through death, He might preſent us holy and unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.22. For ſeeing the children are partakers of fleſh and blood, Hee alſo Himſelfe likewiſe tooke part of the ſame, that through death Hee might deſtroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devill, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. Reade
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:107656:130"/>the Chapter, from verſe 5. unto the end, and ſee how many arguments you find to this purpoſe onely.</p>
                           <p>The fancies therefore of theſe Hereticks, being lighter than vanity, it will follow, that all thoſe opinions which might ſeeme to bee raiſed there-from, were as falſe as fooliſh. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> As firſt, that of <hi>Celſas,</hi> That the body of Chriſt was not ſubject to paine, and griefe: Againſt which, Saint <hi>Origen</hi> diſputes, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cont.

And concerning the joy of His Spirit, <hi>See Luke.</hi> 10.21. <hi>Secondly,</hi>

                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> that of the neat-heard <hi>Baſilides,</hi> who taught that <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Cyrene</hi> was crucifyed in <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſtead, <hi>Epiph. Har.</hi> 24. Of all which, if any thing were true; what thanks were due to Him from vs, when He had ſuffered nothing for our ſakes? 2. How are wee freed from that damnation, under which we were brought through the ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> while the Divine Iuſtice is yet unſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? 3. And if <hi>Chriſt</hi> have not ſuffered for vs, what example hath He left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, that wee ſhould follow his ſteps? 4. Wee that are the Diſciples, ſhould bee above our Maſter-our patience more then His, our love to Him, more then His to vs, If wee for His ſake ſhould willingly ſuffer, perſecution, ſhame, loſſe, impriſonment, death, which He Himſelfe had not ſuffered for vs. And 5. It had been utterly to no end, that He ſhould have become man. For as it had been in vaine for Him to have taken a body which ſhould againe have beene ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into that from whence it was taken (as <hi>Apelles</hi> affirmed) ſo had it beene to no end to take a body, and therein to ſuffer the darkning of His divine glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, if by that body, no benefit had redounded to the creature. But if you deſire moe reaſons hereto, they that are brought in the Chapter for His ſuffering, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying, death, and buryall, may give you full ſatisfaction.</p>

                              </gap>rrours that are yet remaining about the ſuffering of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are two; one of the <hi>Theopaſchites,</hi> 
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> who held that the God-head of <hi>Chriſt</hi> did ſuffer, while His body was nayled on the Croſſe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> 
                              <hi>Aug. de. Haer. Cap.</hi> 73. The other of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triſpaſſians,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Praxeas</hi> and <hi>Sabellius,</hi> who becauſe they thought, that as the Father and the Son were but one ſubſtance ſo were they likewiſe but one Perſon; and therefore they affirmed that God the Father was incarnate, and ſuffered, <hi>Aug. de Haer. Cap.</hi> 41. But the former of theſe is ſufficiently reproved by the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the 9. <hi>Cha.</hi> For if God be not any kind of matier, nor a compound, nor a formed body, nor ſubject to any accident, but that His being be moſt ſimple and pure as was there ſhewed; by every one of theſe circumſtances, it will follow ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily, that God cannot ſuffer. The later is refuted by all the reaſons of the 11. and 23. Chapters: And if you hold not your ſelfe ſatisfied by that which is brought in thoſe Chapters, and the anſweres to the reaſons of <hi>Sabellius,</hi> Note <hi>(d)</hi> on <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. You may doe well to read <hi>Epiph.

                           <p>
                              <hi>(b) That by His partaking of our ſufferings, He might, &amp;c.]</hi> It may heere not vnſitly be demanded, for what cauſes Chriſt the Holy one of God ſhould die for vs, and how that death becomes availeable to free vs from the power of ſinne, of death, and hell? For anſwere, Wee muſt firſt put that which was the firſt and principall cauſe of our ſalvation, the eternall purpoſe of God, which He purpoſed in <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> our <hi>Lord, Ephe.</hi> 3.11. <hi>See Actes</hi> 2.23. And this, not for any graces or workes fore-ſeene in us, <hi>But according to the good pleaſure of His owne will, Ephe.</hi> 1.5. <hi>For He hath ſaved us, and called us with an Holy calling, not according to our workes, but according to His owne purpoſe and grace, which was given us in Chriſt Ieſus, before the world began.</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. And he that puts any
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:107656:130"/>outward cauſe, or good workes fore-ſeene in us, whereby God might bee mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to chuſe us, takes away the chiefe glory of his grace, and makes him to bee leſſe good. So then, the firſt cauſe of all the cauſes and meanes of our ſalvation in Chriſt, is the free mercy and purpoſe of God the Father, which becauſe it is the firſt, it muſt needes alſo be the chiefe cauſe, ſeeing all other cames worke to that end to which they are ordered and guided by the firſt. And becauſe the Son doth nothing of Himſelfe, but what things ſoever He ſeeth the Father doe, thoſe alſo doth the Sonne likewiſe: <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.19. Therefore ſecondly did the Sonne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that eternall purpoſe of the Father, offer Himſelfe vnto His Father for man, as a ranſome and ſatisfaction for their ſinne, as it is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.7. <hi>Loe I come (in the volume of the Booke it is written of mee) to doe thy will O God. Heb.</hi> 10.7. <hi>For in Him onely is God well pleaſed, Matth.</hi> 12.18. <hi>And this is that Eternall Goſpel of the Lambe, ſlaine from the foundation of the World, Apoc.</hi> 13.8: <hi>For through the Eternall Spirit did He offer Himſelfe without ſpot vnto God.</hi> But if this offer of our Redeemer, who offered Himſelfe for vs, had not beene accepted of His Father, then had it beene of no availe for us. Therefore in the third place, it muſt appeare that God did accept this Sacrifice of His Sonne, which is manifeſt firſt by this: That it was the diſpoſition and purpoſe of God Himſelfe, as was ſhewed in the firſt place, and as it is ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10. <hi>By the will of God are wee ſanctified, through the offering of the body of Ieſus Chriſt, once for all.</hi> Neither was God in this reconciliation of man-kind, a willer or diſpoſer onely, but a worker alſo of our Redemption. <hi>For God was in Chriſt, reconciling the World vnto himſelfe,</hi> not imputing their treſpaſſes vnto them. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. If God then be for us, who can be againſt us? If He Iuſtifie, who can condemne us? who have the decree and will of God for our Iuſtification, the offer and acceptance of Chriſt, both God and man, for our ranſome and reconciliation, and that offer was made by the eternall Spirit, <hi>And this Spirit alſo beareth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to our Spirit, that wee are the ſonnes of God, Rom.</hi> 8.16. The ſecond cauſe concernes the juſtice of God, by which our Lord Chriſt died for vs. And it ſtond in this, that He according to the will of His Father, became our ſurety, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7.22. and bound Himſelfe to make ſatisfaction for the ſin of man, which ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap> this ſatisfaction of Chriſt, the infinite Iuſtice was accorded with the infinite Love of God to the creature. The infinite love appeared, as was ſaid before, firſt in this, that the Sonne was called and appointed to the performance of this glorious worke. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 5. <hi>verſe</hi> 4, 5.10. Then in this, that being performed, it was accepted in our name, and for our everlaſting happineſſe, as it is ſaid, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that He gave His onely begotten Sonne; that whoſoever beleeveth Him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi> The infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Iuſtice was manifeſt in this, that the ſatisfaction of Chriſt was a full and perfect ſatisfaction, according to the rigour of Iuſtice, and that both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the infinite value thereof, and of the puniſhment which our Mediator endured. The infinite value of the ſatisfaction, was firſt in the Perſon that offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it. For as the grieuouſneſſe of the injurie exceeded by the worthineſſe of the Perſon of the Father, that was offended: So the value of the ſatisfaction ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by the worthineſſe of the Sonne, that ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>e the amends. And becauſe the honour which was done to God herein, is valued according to the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Perſon, which worthineſſe in <hi>Chriſt</hi> is eſſentiall unto him, not acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall, as that of <hi>Aaron,</hi> therfore the ſatisfaction alſo is eſſentially infinite, and therefore abundantly ſufficient in reſpect of the Perſon that did fulfill it. For the ſatisfaction to an infinite Iuſtice, was as fully made by the Perſon of the Sonne an infinite being, than if the creature being finite, even all Angels and men had ſuffered the torments of hell eternally. Secondly, the infinite value of the ſatisfaction appeares in the worthineſſe of the thing that was offered. For our Mediator having no greater nor better ſacrifice to offer unto God (as
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:107656:131"/>nothing could be better then that which was equall to God) offered Himſelfe God and man, for the ſaving of His people, as it is ſaid, <hi>Ier.</hi> 3.23. <hi>Truly in the Lord our God is the ſalvation of Iſrael.</hi> Thirdly, the value was increaſed by the manner of the offering, wherein was the perfection of the obedience of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Son to His Father, and the perfect ſubmiſsion of the humane will of Chriſt, unto the will of God, that this ſacrifice might by all meanes be meritorious in Him for us, <hi>See Note (g) on Chap.</hi> 24. §. 11. <hi>No.</hi> 4.</p>
                           <p>The ſecond meanes whereby the ſatisfaction of Chriſt according to the rigour of Iuſtice was perfect, is the greatneſſe of that puniſhment which He endured for us, which in proportion was anſwerable to that death which in Iuſtice was due to the ſinne of man, having the ſame degrees and parts: which puniſhment Chriſt (ſo farre foorth as it was poſsible for the Sonne of God) did endure. Firſt, the bodily death, with all the circumſtances, as I remembred before: Then the loſſe of that Ioy and Comfort of His ſoule, wherewith the fruition of God, and the fulneſſe of His graces did euer repleniſh Him. And this Ioy Hee loſt, not finally or fundamentally, as the damned (for that was impoſsible, both in reſpect of His innocencie, and of His union with God) but onely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the preſent act and feeling. Thirdly, he was ſubjected to the powers of hell, not enthralled thereto as a vaſſall, but yet ſubject for the preſent vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and temptation: ſo that His ſoule and underſtanding was affrighted in ſorrow and horrour, knowing Himſelfe to be made a curſe for us, which brought with it a full ſence of the Iuſtice and wrath of God againſt ſinne. Fourthly, and although it bee moſt true that God cannot ſuffer either paine or loſſe, as was ſhewed even now; yet it is as true, that God having taken to Himſelfe the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Tabernacle of a ſoule and body, offered this ſoule and body of His to death for us as it is ſaid, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. That God purchaſed His Church with His owne blood; and not ſo onely, but for a time left that body under the abſolute power of Death and Buriall.</p>
                           <p>And thus the Iuſtice why Chriſt ſhould die for our ſinnes, and the plenary ſatisfaction which Hee hath made unto God thereby doeth plainely appeare. Now a reaſon or two, why, and how the benefit hereof doth belong unto us.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Firſt, ſeeing the perſon of our Redeemer is infinite, and therefore His merit alſo infinite, an infinite reward is due thereunto, which if God would not give (O pardon that we ſpeake in the voyce of reaſon Thy gift in us) then Hee were unjuſt; if He could not, then were He unable to requite. But both theſe things are impoſsible. And ſeeing hee that makes a recompenſe for any deſert, either gives to the deſerver that which he hath not, or forgives that which hee might require; and yet our Lord, to whom the reward of His obedience and death is due, neither needs any thing, nor can receive any thing more then He hath, having in Himſelfe the fulneſſe of all perfection, and all things which the Father hath, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.10. Neither yet needs forgiveneſſe, having never offended: neither yet can ſo great obedience, and ſuch an infinite merit bee all in vaine, therefore doth this infinite reward redound to us: ſo that we which claime by His Title, may draw neere unto the Throne of Grace in the full aſſurance of faith, that God doth not, nor will not refuſe them that come unto Him in the name of His Sonne, ſeeing unto all them that ſeeke ſalvation and eternall life by Him, all His infinite merit doeth aſſuredly belong. For that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite can no way become diviſible, for ſo ſhould it ceaſe to bee infinite. So His infinite merit belongs to every one of His, according to the infinity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. See the doore of our hope ſet open wider then the walles of heaven: See how God with Chriſt hath given us all things: See alſo if the infinite merit of Chriſt, can any way be compatible of any mans merit, or the mediation of Saints.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Seeing our Lord Ieſus being God, could not become man but by the power of God, <hi>Chap.</hi> 25. <hi>&amp;</hi> 26. who of the whole nature and ſubſtance of the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:107656:131"/>Virgin, made Him perfect man, both ſoule and body: And that He being thus alſo the Sonne of God and man, did perfectly fulfill the law of a Sonne, to doe alwayes thoſe things which were pleaſing to His Father, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.29. whereas all other men had revolted from their obedience, and ſo forfeited their ſtate of Son-ſhip and intereſt in their Fathers inheritance, by the ſinne o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

But becauſe the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of eternall happineſſe is due to Him by a double right, not onely that of Sonne-ſhip, or inheritance, but alſo by purchaſe, through the infinite merit of His moſt pretious death; whereto, according to the will of His Father, He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came obedient for the ſinne of man-kind; therefore by this right, hath He given an infinite right in the heavenly Inheritance, to all them that come unto Him by a lively faith, their hearts being clenſed from dead workes, to ſerve the living God. In which right, If He had not fully ſtated man-kind, then had the benefit of His purchaſe beene utterly loſt. So His Incarnation, His ſufferings, and all His promiſes made to vs, had beene in vaine. But all theſe things are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Moreover, it is to bee conſidered, that the ſinne of man in reſpect of the ſinner, muſt needs bee finite, becauſe a finite creature can no way doe an infinite action, but the infinitie of the ſinne is onely in reſpect of Him againſt whom the ſinne is, becauſe of His infinite Iuſtice that is offended thereby. But the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and the merit of Chriſts death was infinite, not onely in reſpect of the infinitie or His Perſon who performed it, but of Him alſo that did ſo accept it, of Him that was not bound thereto in reſpect of any neede or debt of His owne, but He performed all that obedience which was due for our ſakes, and in our name: where a the merit of all other men being finite, could no way be ſatisfactorie for their ſin againſt an infinite Iuſtice; neither yet can they bee ſo accepted of God, becauſe mans workes, how good ſoever they are, yet can they neither be moe, nor better than man is bound unto, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.10. Neither are good workes truely ours, but ſuch as God hath done by us. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. But ſeeing all our righteouſneſſe is as filthy raggs, <hi>Eſay</hi> 46.6. let us looke unto <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> who alone of God, is made unto us Wiſedome, Righteouſneſſe, Sanctification, and Redemption. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. And as the ranſome of our ſinne muſt of neceſsitie be of an infinite value, that it might be a full ſatisfaction to an infinite Iuſtice, and therefore fit that our Redeemer ſhould beeboth God and man: So was it neceſſary that Hee ſhould become ours, that wee might have that which we might give unto God for a full ſatisfaction; And that our obligation to God might bee infinite, not onely for our creation, or being from nothing; but much more for our well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and reſtoring from worſe than nothing: Therefore that wee might have an infinite ranſome to give unto him, did Hee firſt give unto us His only Sonne, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.16. And yet that our claime and right might bee in Him, not onely by the voluntary gift of His Father, which in Him that had power to give, made our right and poſſeſsion ſure enough; but alſo by our owne purchaſe, that wee might have all manner of right in Him, and aſſurance of Him, therefore at His owne, rice of five Shekels of ſilver (<hi>Sixeteene ſhillings Eight pence, Hen.

O moſt rich and precious purchaſe! At ſo eaſie a rate, to buy that which was more worth than all the worlds! And that the benefit of this bargaine might not redound to the <hi>Iewes</hi> alone, therefore came the wiſe <hi>Gentiles</hi> from the Eaſt to relieve the penury of the poore Carpenter, not onely for the payment of this purchaſe, but alſo for ſaving of that which was bought, by His ſlight into <hi>Egypt, Matth.</hi> 2.

                           <p>Thus then, the infinite Iuſtice being fully ſatisfied in our nature by that which <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath ſuffered for us, our ſinnes are not onely freely forgiven us in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved; but wee are alſo brought into the perfect favour and Love of God, and the aſſurance of thoſe benefits which depend thereon.

                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> Now according to theſe takings of the words, different in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations have beene made of this Article, of which, becauſe ſo much hath already beene written among our ſelues, I may, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to be more briefe. But becauſe ſome formes of confeſſion have left this Article out, therefore it hath growne queſtionable, whether it was alwayes in this Creed of the Apoſtles, or not. Of the Apoſtles, I ſay, or Apoſtolicall men, their hearers, gathered as the ſumme of the Apoſtles doctrine, concerning the Faith. And true it is, that as it cannot be ſaid, by whom, where, or when, this Creed was firſt compoſed, as being the moſt ancient in this kind; the reſt being onely explications of ſome points herein, made upon occaſions of hereſies, or doubts thereabout: So doe ſome men cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely affirme, that all the other Articles were not put together at once. Yet is it without doubt, that this Article is as ancient as the reſt that are found in the Creed; ſeeing the moſt ancient a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Fathers, <hi>Athanaſius, Origen, Tertullian, Irenaeus</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, have ſo received and declared it. And therefore that fancy of <hi>Eraeſmus,</hi> who ſuſpected that <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> might foy'ſt it in, was farre below both the one and the other, ſeeing it is confeſt by <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> who lived within the firſt 400. yeeres after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to have beene in the Creed uſed in the Church of <hi>Aquileia,</hi> and ſo by him interpreted with the reſt. But although the Councell at <hi>Nice</hi> in <hi>Bithinia,</hi> left it out of their Creed, becauſe their ſpeciall buſineſſe was againſt <hi>Arius</hi> concerning the Deitie of our <hi>Saviour;</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>Arians</hi> in their Councell at <hi>Nice</hi> in <hi>Thracia,</hi> put it in their Creed; nay although <hi>Aquinas</hi> had firſt put it in, were it therefore fit to leave it out, or not to count it an Article of Faith, as ſome would doe? I thinke not, ſeeing the holy Scripture gives authority to it. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 16.10. referred to Chriſt by the expoſition of Saint <hi>Peter, Actes</hi> 2.27. ſeeing all the Chriſtian Churches have receiued it, and ſeeing that according to the true and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary meaning thereof, there is no Article of the Creed, which doth more clearely and directly overthrow the hereſies of <hi>Arius,</hi> and the <hi>Dimaeritae,</hi> concerning the humane ſoule of Chriſt, of which you read, <hi>Chapter</hi> 26. <hi>Note (a)</hi> § 2.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Now concerning the different interpretations; Some accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the firſt meaning of <hi>Sheol</hi> and <hi>Hades,</hi> for the Grave, thinke that Chriſt was truely buried, and kept in the Grave three dayes, and that this Article had no other meaning, but a further declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:107656:133"/>of <hi>Dead</hi> and <hi>Buried,</hi> againſt the opinion of <hi>Marcion, Valentin,</hi> and ſuch other heretickes as denyed the trueth of Chriſts being, and His ſuffering, as you heard before, <hi>Note (a)</hi> on <hi>Chap.</hi> 27.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Others would, that beyond the death and buriall, it ſhould impart a diſpoſing of His body to corruption. But if their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning therein be this, That the body of our Lord was laid in the grave where corruption doth ſeaze on the bodies of other men, then this blind deſcent can looke no further then His buriall; or if it muſt needs meane any thing more, then would they force us, by this Article, to beleeve and confeſſe that which by the Scripture we know to be falſe. For it was impoſſible that the holy One of God ſhould either ſee corruption, or be brought to any degree or diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition thereunto, beyond the death and buriall of His body. <hi>See Acts</hi> 2.24, 27.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Some other, by this deſcent of Chriſt, will underſtand the uttermoſt degree of His humiliation, that could come unto Him while His Soule was parted from the Body, His honour laid in the duſt, the devill and his inſtruments triumphing over Him. But the Creed was not framed to teach us the triumph and ioy of His ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but His victory and their confuſion. And concerning our Lord Himſelfe, this goes no further then either of the former inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations, except in that ſence which you ſhall heare anon. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none of theſe can be the meaning of this Article. For in the abridgement or ſumme of our Faith, interpretations are not fit, eſpecially ſuch as are more darke than that to which they ſhould give light. Therefore this Article <hi>Hee deſcended into hell,</hi> cannot in any of the former meanings, be a declaration of that <hi>Hee was dead and buryed.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. A fourth interpretation is, of them who thinke the deſcent of <hi>Christ</hi> meanes thus much onely. That His ſoule being departed out of His body, went unto the ſoules of the faithfull which were in Paradiſe, which they interpret heaven. But ſeeing heaven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken not metaphorically, for Ioy and happineſſe, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly for a place; muſt in all ſence ſignifie that which is upward from the earth: It muſt needes bee a very aukward interpretation of <hi>He deſcended into hell,</hi> to ſay, <hi>He aſcended or went upward into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi> yet becauſe this interpretation brings both reaſon and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, it ſhall bee examined by and by.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. A fift interpretation is, of them who will have this deſcent to ſignifie nothing elſe but the endurance of thoſe unſpeakable ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, and torments which He ſuffered in ſoule, being in His ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and on the croſſe.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. A ſixt ſence is, of them who hold that Hee did locally goe downe to hell; ſo that according to the eſſence or being of His ſoule, He was truely preſent there. And as the former of theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie not, but that <hi>Christ</hi> by His death did utterly ſpoile the powers of darkneſſe, and ſo may be ſaid virtually, and by the effects of His
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:107656:134"/>ſuffering, to have gone downe into hell, becauſe that by the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall offering of Himſelfe a ranſome for the ſinnes of the world, and the performance thereof in the time appointed, He did utterly free all His beleevers from Hell, which was their due, and ſetled them in the inheritance of eternall life: ſo theſe latter (for the moſt part) denie not but that all this which is ſaid, is agreeable to the trueth of the Scripture, and the analogie of Faith: onely they cannot yeeld that it is the true and native meaning of this Article. And betweene theſe two parties, all thoſe texts of Scripture which are brought for the locall deſcent of <hi>Christ,</hi> are hammered ſo thinne, that may ſeeme plyable every way: But let the ſtrength of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Text for ever ſtand ſure, and let us ſee the reaſons a little on all ſides, with their anſweres and exceptions. And firſt of them that interpret this Article by the ſufferings of <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſoule.</p>

                           <hi>Object.</hi> 1. <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> As the ſufferings of <hi>Christ,</hi> even from the firſt minute of His Incarnation, were meritorious for us; yet our ranſome from the torments of hell, was wrought eſpecially by the ſuffering of His humane ſoule, which torments of His ſoule Hee endured, not onely by the torture or fellow-feeling of His naturall body, nor by compaſsion onely on the ſins and ſorrowes of His body myſticall, but alſo He might be ſaid even to feele the ſorrowes of eternall death, when He ſaw Himſelfe to be now ſet to ſuffer the wrath of God due to the ſinnes of the whole world. And if this bee not the proper and native ſence of this Article, how are wee taught by our Creed, to beleeve more concerning <hi>Christ,</hi> than wee confeſſe to be true of the theeves; of whom wee may ſay, they ſuffered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> that they were crucified, dead, and buryed: <hi>Al. Hume. Rejoynd. to Doctor Hil. I anſwere,</hi> Firſt the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is profitable for doctrine, for inſtruction, for reproofe, &amp;c. But the object of our faith is onely the <hi>Holy Trinity</hi> in <hi>Vnity,</hi> and the ſatisfaction of <hi>Christ,</hi> for our Redemption, and the benefits which wee receive thereby. And therefore although I beleeve and know by the Scriptures, that <hi>Samſon</hi> was the Sonne of <hi>Manoa,</hi> yet I neither beleeve in <hi>Samſon,</hi> nor <hi>Manoa:</hi> And though I know by the Scriptures that the penitent thiefe ſuffered under <hi>Pontius Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi> was crucifyed, and dyed, yet I beleeve not in him. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Christ,</hi> as I beleeve that all His merits redound to us; ſo I beleeve that all His ſufferings were according to the Scripture, a ſatisfaction to the juſtice of God, for the ſinnes of the world: which they could not be, but by the ſuffering both of His ſoule and body, as it is ſaid, <hi>Eſay.</hi> 53. <hi>Hee ſhall ſee the travaile of His ſoule, and bee ſatisfied.</hi> If then wee know that whatſoever befell un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Lord, was that the Scripture might be fulfilled, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.54.56. and if wee beleeve and confeſſe in our Creed, that He ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red according to the Scriptures, and dyed, and roſe againe according to the Scriptures: and that the Scriptures doe plainely teſtifie, that by His ſufferings and death, the wrath of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:107656:134"/>God againſt mans ſinne, is fully ſatisfied; which (as I ſaid) could not be, but by His ſufferings in His ſoule, as well as in His body: After theſe ſufferings under <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> what needes a ſecond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of His ſuffrings in ſoule, under a title of a deſcent into hell? Therefore, when as I am bound to beleeve and confeſſe, that the ſufferings of Chriſt under <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> were according to the Scriptures, that is, in ſoule and body, I am bound to deny, that the ſuffering of Chriſt in His ſoule, is the native meaning of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, <hi>He deſcended into hell.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. Beſide the doctrine of Faith, being a catechiſme doctrine. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. and the ſum thereof being for the uſe of children and novices, it is not likely that the Church would have ſo generally received a creed, wherin the thing to be beleeved ſhould be laid down inwords, that were tropicall and obſcure, when plaine and proper termes were neceſſary, and at hand. But hell cannot ſignifie the torments of hell, but by a <hi>metonymia</hi> of the place for the adjunct of the place: neither yet could it properly be ſaid, That our Saviour went down into bell, when He was lifted up upon the Croſſe, where the eſpeciall endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and expreſſion of His helliſh torments were both in ſoule and body. 2. Neither can it truely be ſaid, <hi>He deſcended into hell,</hi> that is, He ſuffered in ſoule the torments of hell, but by a <hi>Synecdoche</hi> of the whole man for one part. Neither were theſe torments of His ſoule, more properly or truely, called torments of hel, then thoſe torments of His body, which we confeſſe, He ſuffered under <hi>Pontius Pilate.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. Moreover, after He was dead and buried, it comes in unduly, againe to make mention of His ſufferings in ſoule, a great part of which were endured in the garden, before He came to the hands, either of <hi>Pilate,</hi> or of the Prieſts.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. And yet beyond all theſe reaſons, there is another argument, that the Church did not interpret this Article by the ſufferings of Chriſts Soule, becauſe as <hi>Gerrardus Voſsius</hi> puts it, <hi>De ſtatu animae ſeparatae Qu:</hi> 1. <hi>It was the received</hi> opinion of the ancient Fathers, even to this our time, That the ſoules of the faithfull, before Chriſt entred not into Paradiſe, till Chriſt by His death had ſet it open, and entred thereinto, according to His promiſe to the thiefe on the Croſſe. And if all the ſoules of the faithfull were in hell, (taken in the ſecond ſence before mentioned) though in a place of reſt (as <hi>Theophilus</hi> ſpeakes) and that by the comming of Chriſt thither, they were brought to Paradiſe, or a place of further joy; then certainely this Article muſt in their iudgement, be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the deſcent of Chriſt into hell after his death, rather then by the ſorrowes of His ſoule before it. And to this purpoſe the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Voſsius</hi> brings ſome 20. Fathers from <hi>Tacianus</hi> the ſchollar of <hi>Iuſtin Martyr,</hi> about the yeere of Chriſt 180. before whom He might have put His maſter <hi>Iuſtin,</hi> as it is plaine in his <hi>Triphon.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe Fathers are <hi>Irenaeus, Tertullian, Origen, Euſebius, Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius, Ambroſe, Ierom, Epiphanius, Chryſoſtom, Auguſtin, Cyril,</hi> and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:107656:135"/>beſide them whom he reckons up, he ads [innumerable others] and with them the ſentence of the Councill of <hi>Toledo</hi> in the yeere 633. He deſcended into Hell, that He might free them which were there detained. <hi>Aug. Ep:</hi> 99. writes thus; If the reaſon be asked, why our Saviour would come into hell, where thoſe ſorrowes are, of which He could not be held: it was, <hi>Becauſe He was free among the dead. Pſal.</hi> 88.5. Moreover, concerning the firſt Father of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, almoſt the whole Church agrees, that He freed him there, which may not be thought that the Church beleeved without cauſe, although the expreſſe authority of the Canonicall Scripture be not alleadged. He ſaith, almoſt the whole Church, becauſe the heretickes, called <hi>Tacians,</hi> denyed that <hi>Adam</hi> was ſaved, <hi>De Haereſ. Cap.</hi> 25. <hi>Voſsius,</hi> beſide all theſe, brings the conſent of the <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane,</hi> and of the Eaſterne Churches, both of the <hi>Greekes</hi> and of the <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> with divers later writers, as <hi>Zuinglius, P.

                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label> But the Fathers agreed not all in one judgement. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> True: Neither yet they of later times. For concerning the end of His going to hell, ſome thought, that He delivered all that He found there, both good and bad indifferently. 2. Others becauſe they thought that the whole puniſhment for mans ſinne could not otherwiſe be diſcharged, ſaid that He went to hell, that He might there ſuffer, for the ſoules of men, as on His Croſſe He had ſuffered for their bodies. Nay, as <hi>Poſtel. de nat. Med.</hi> relates, the <hi>Abiſsine</hi> Church holds, that He went thither for His owne ſoule. This laſt is hereticall; the other, againſt the direct authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Scripture. For our Lord Himſelfe, when He gave up the Ghoſt, profeſſed, That whatſoever was neceſſary for His ſuffering, and our redemption, was then finiſhed. And therefore both Saint <hi>Peter</hi> 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2.24. ſaith, <hi>That He bare our ſinnes in His body on the tree;</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul, Coloſ.</hi> 1.20. <hi>That Hee wrought our peace, through the blood of His Croſſe,</hi> And <hi>Chapter</hi> 2.15. <hi>Hee ſpoyled the principalities and powers, &amp; triumphed over them openly in His Croſſe.</hi> Beſide, His promiſe to the thiefe, <hi>This day to bee with Him in para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,</hi> doth directly croſſe this opinion. 3. Others, upon that text of 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19. <hi>He went and preached unto the Spirits in priſon, which were diſobedient in the dayes of Noah,</hi> thinke that He went to hell to upbraid to them their infidelity. But this was not according to the end of His comming, which was to ſeeke and to ſave that which was loſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.10. Therefore others, and with them <hi>Martinus Cellarius, de operibus Dei,</hi> thinke that He preached repentance unto them, and that ſuch as beleeved Him to be God, were redeemed from hell, and ſaved by Him. But becauſe our Church hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected this opinion; compare the Synod <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. with the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod <hi>Eliz.</hi> therefore I refuſe it. And that text of <hi>Peter</hi> may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, of the preaching of <hi>Noah,</hi> while the <hi>Arke</hi> was preparing. 5. Some againe, on better ground then the former, thinke, that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:107656:135"/>that deſcent of His into Hell, was for manifeſtation or inveſting of Himſelfe in that Lordſhip which He, as the Sonne of man, had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the creature, and conſequently over the powers of hell, <hi>That at His Name every knee ſhould bow, both of things in Heaven, and of things in earth, and of things under the earth. Phil.</hi> 2.10. Thus, <hi>He that liveth and was dead, is alive for evermore; and hath the keyes of hell and of death. Thus He that deſcended firſt into the lower parts of the earth, did aſcend farre above all heavens, that Hee might fulfill all things. Epheſ.</hi> 4.9, 10. That fluttering diſtinction, That He, as God, dwelt in the man-hood on the earth, the lower part of the world, and then He as man aſcended, will not helpe. For firſt, euery globe of the Moone, the Sun, or any ſtar, as it hath a centre to which every thing thereon inclines, for otherwiſe it could not hold together in one body: ſo is it a centre to the univerſe that is about it. And ſo is likewiſe the loweſt, in compariſon of thoſe globes that have diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent centres. Beſide, He which deſcended, is even the ſame that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended: But God and man are not the ſame. Thirdly, He deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and aſcended, that He might fill all things, which God did for ever, neither aſcending, nor deſcending. And therefore <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaid well, <hi>Totus Filius fuit apud Patrem, &amp;c.</hi> The Sonne was whole with the Father, whole in the Virgins wombe, whole in Heauen, whole in Earth, whole on the Croſſe, whole in Hell. 6. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever private opinions might fall in by the way, yet by that which was ſaid before, it is manifeſt that the ancient Church did beleeve that Chriſt did therefore deſcend into hell, that the faithfull by Him might be brought into Paradiſe; which if it were the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them that did compoſe, and of them that did generally receive the Creed, then cannot that Article of Chriſts deſcent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell, be interpreted according to their meaning, which ſay, That it muſt ſignifie no other thing, but that He ſuffered the paines of hell in His ſoule. Concerning them that received the Creed, and interpreted it, you have heard, § 3.4. and ſhall further heare their meaning. The Authors meaning you ſhall heare anone.</p>

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:107656:136"/>authority of the Canonicall Scriptures, which ought to be the ground and rule of our Faith.

But if their miſtaking were indeed <hi>Auguſtines</hi> meaning, That the deſcent of Chriſt into hell had no authority of the Canonicall Scripture; yet remembring that it may not be thought that the Church, yea, the whole Church belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it without cauſe, ſeeing it hath no inconvenience in it, ſeeing it is not contrary to the Scripture, and that the holy Scriptures, by <hi>Anſelmes</hi> judgement [cited in the Preface] confirmes all that which it doeth no way contradict, being lawfully gathered from manifeſt reaſon; Let us be bold to looke upon the Reaſons which may ſeeme to have drawne the ancient Church unto this opinion.</p>
                        <p>And becauſe it is neceſſary firſt to agree vpon ſome principles; let it be put, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> that theſe words <hi>He deſcended into Hell,</hi> are not ſpoken either of the God-head of <hi>Christ,</hi> of which it is confeſſed, that it is every where, nor yet of His dead body, of which it is ſaid in the Article before, that it was buryed; but that the enquiry is heere, what became of the ſoule of our Saviour, after it was departed from His body. Secondly, That ſeeing the ſoule neither came to nothing, nor was an infinite being, to bee every where, it muſt of neceſſitie be in ſome definite <hi>ubi,</hi> ſome place, where while it was, it was not in another. Thirdly, Seeing the ſoule of <hi>Christ</hi> was a true humane ſoule as one of ours, and that it became Him in all things to bee like His brethren, except their ſinne: His ſoule alſo being ſeparate from the body, went unto that place where the ſoules of the faithfull were before His comming. This I thinke none will denie; the Doctors old and new, come all hereto. The Reverend <hi>P. Martyr, in Symb.</hi> ſaith thus, <hi>Deſcendit anima Chriſti ad inferos, &amp;c.</hi> The ſoule of <hi>Christ</hi> deſcended into hell, meanes no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, but that it did undergoe the ſame eſtate, which other ſoues being ſeparate from the body, had experience of. So <hi>Muſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus in Eph.</hi> 4.9. <hi>Deſcendit ad nos in hunc mundum, &amp;c.</hi> He deſcended to us in this world, unto the grave, and unto hell. He deſcended to them whom He came to redeeme: and as farre as they either living or dying, had deſcended; ſo farre alſo did He Himſelfe deſcend, that He might lift them up from below, unto thoſe places above, from which He had deſcended. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſaid as much long agoe. <hi>Lib</hi> 5. <hi>Cap. ult.</hi> The Lord kept the law of the dead, that He might bee the firſt-begotten from the dead. Hitherto it ſeemes, all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are agreed: But the aſſumptions ſet them at oddes againe, as farre as heaven and hell. For the old Interpreters inferre that the faithfull before <hi>Christ,</hi> were in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, or in hell, taken in the ſecond ſence: But the new Interpreters inferre thus. But the faithfull which were before <hi>Chriſt,</hi> were in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:107656:136"/>that is, aſcended into heaven, properly ſo called. For ſo the word Paradiſe doth ſignifie, by the expreſſe authority of the Scripture, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>verſe</hi> 2. and 4. where the third heaven by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> is called Paradiſe. For the firſt heaven is this of the Ayre to the Moone. The ſecond heaven is, that of the Planets and Starres; and the third heaven is Paradiſe, the place of the bleſſed ſoules. And this is one of the Arguments of them that reject the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Fathers, and the ancient Church, and holde the tropi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call interpretation of hell, for helliſh torments of the mind. And becauſe I am here fallen into theſe bryars, I will firſt put fire to them, and afterward goe forward to the concluſion. Therefore I anſwere. The firſt heaven is, this of the foules of heaven, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.20. The ſecond is, that of the cloudes of heaven. <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.7. So the third heaven for Paradiſe, is in the Moone. But this concluſion you laugh at. Therefore you ſee on how weake and ungrounded principles they diſpute. 2. Beſide, is there no difference between a thing really performed, and a viſion, as that of <hi>Paul,</hi> which is not by things actually being, but repreſented onely for inſtruction to the Prophet that ſees it. 3. But to grant all, that the third hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is Paradiſe, and that the third heaven muſt ſignifie that which is above all the ſtarres; is there no Paradiſe beſide, when every place of pleaſure is a Paradiſe? Therefore though Saint <hi>Paul</hi> were in the third heaven, yet the faithfull ſoules might bee in another Paradiſe, before they came thither, as <hi>Adam</hi> was.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Objection.</hi> This is contrary to the firſt concluſion of <hi>Voſsius; That the faithfull before Chriſt were not in Paradiſe, till Christ opened it by His comming thither with the thiefe.</hi>

                           <hi>Anſwere.</hi> It croſſes not the opinion of the Fathers. For though they put all the ſoules of the Saints in hell; whither they alſo ſent the ſoule of <hi>Christ:</hi> yet they put them there, into a place of reſt and refreſhing, into a higher place; in death free from torments, and the tyranny of the devill, and that by the authority of that hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call parable in <hi>Luke</hi> 16. where <hi>Lazarus</hi> on the one ſide of the gulph was in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome comforted; the rich man in flames on the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

So that firſt place or Paradiſe, was that ſtate or quiet, wherein the faithfull ſoules reſted from their labours of this life, <hi>Iob</hi> 3. from <hi>verſe</hi> 13. to 20. in Ioy and hope of Him that was to come. But that Paradiſe which the Fathers meant, was a more free ſtate, and the enjoying of a fuller happineſſe by the preſence of <hi>Christ,</hi> the worke of their redemption being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, they having their Redeemer with them, a ſure pledge of their enterance into heaven, after their reſurrection; as He ſhould forthwith bee raiſed, and aſcend to heaven; whither till that time they had no hope to come.</p>

For many Prophets and Kings deſired to ſee the day of <hi>Christ,</hi> yet ſaw it not, but as they ſaluted the promiſſes afarre off, by their Faith. The bodies alſo of divers Saints were raiſed at the reſurrection of <hi>Christ,</hi> and appeared to ſuch as had knowne them alive, for proofe of all that benefit, whereof all the faithfull ſhall bee partakers. Which bleſſing, neither <hi>Daniel, Dan.</hi> 12.13. nor <hi>Paul,</hi> are yet partakers of. And this anſwere may ſerve for divers texts of Scripture, which are unfitly brought to this purpoſe, as that of <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.24. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.14. and ſuch others. And therefore though it bee moſt certaine and true, according to the Scriptures, that the Goſpel of <hi>Christ</hi> was an eternall Goſpel, and that His death was available to eternall life, to all that beleeved in Him ſince the beginning of the world: So that their ſoules, after they were delivered from the burden of the fleſh, were in Ioy and felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: yet is it as true, which the trueth ſaith, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.2. <hi>In my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe are many Manſions.</hi> So that although the ſoules of the faithfull departed before <hi>Christ,</hi> were in Paradiſe in <hi>Abrahams</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, in the Kingdome of God, in Everlaſting life, yet were they not in heaven properly ſo called, neither could they have the preſence of their Redeemer, when Hee was not yet incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, by whom they might enioy the viſion of God, as now they doe.</p>

So is the reſurrection, and ſo are the degrees in the bleſſedneſſe of the Saints. And if every man that conſiders the diſpoſition of God toward himſelfe in this life, doe looke thereon with a thankefull eye, he may confeſſe with Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> That it hath been ſuch, as if God had neglected His other creatures, to thinke in mercy on him alone.

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:107656:137"/>on two falſe foundations: One of the propoſition: for if the ſame faith muſt have the ſame effects in every quality and degree, Why are not we that have the ſame faith, tranſlated hence as <hi>Henoch</hi> was? The other, of the ſuppoſition; That in the kingdom of glory (which we on both ſides account to begin actually, immediately after this life) there is not a progreſſe from one degree of happineſſe unto another; which as it is contrary to reaſon, ſo is it to the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

Beſide, the holy Text is plaine, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. <hi>That we beholding the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image, from glory to glory.</hi> And how farre, or how long ſhall this be? <hi>Euen till God be all in all.</hi> 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 15.28.

But the queſtion is, of them that died before, who, if they were in heaven already, then the prayer of our Lord, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.24. had beene in vaine; which were wicked blaſphemy for any one to ſay, or thinke. 3.

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:107656:138"/>ſelfe, it is neceſſary that wee paſſe by all the degrees of perfection, from this low eſtate of mortality, wherein wee are, till ſuch time as wee come to bee equall with the Angels, <hi>Luke</hi> 20.36.

                        <p>But I heare one whiſper againſt this, that the ſoule is not ſaid to aſcend without the body, and therefore the ſoules might bee in heaven, though they aſcend not. So the cavill is onely about the word <hi>Aſcend.</hi> But the reaſon? For it is ſaid, <hi>Actes</hi> 2.34. <hi>David is not aſcended up into heaven.</hi> And this was ſpoken by <hi>Peter,</hi> after <hi>Christs</hi> aſcenſion. So that although <hi>Davids</hi> ſoule was not in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven before, but went with <hi>Christ</hi> at his aſcenſion; yet <hi>David</hi> is then ſaid, not to have aſcended. <hi>Al. Hume. Rej.</hi> to Doctor <hi>Hil.</hi> But had this man well conſidered the circumſtances of this text, in the 25. <hi>verſe, David</hi> ſpeaketh concerning <hi>Christ,</hi> and ſo as it followeth in the 29.30.31. he would have taken this text from <hi>David,</hi> as S. <hi>Luke</hi> doth, when he ſaith, <hi>David</hi> is not aſcended, that is, this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth not at all belong to <hi>David,</hi> concerning any aſcending or deſcending of his; but to Him alone of whom <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 100. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my Lord, ſit at my right hand:</hi> The like ſpeech to this, is that of our Lord, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.42. <hi>Not my will, but thy will be done.</hi> And yet it is ſaid of Him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.8. <hi>I delight to doe thy will O my God; Thy law is written in my heart.</hi> So the will of God was done as the firſt moving cauſe of our ſalvation; the wil of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was done as ſubordinate, not as the firſt cauſe, <hi>See Heb.</hi> 10.9. <hi>So</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. <hi>Not I laboured, but the grace of God which was within mee.</hi> And yet who knowes not the labours of <hi>Paul</hi> to have beene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all the reſt of the Apoſtles? 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. <hi>ad finem,</hi> yet he of his owne motion, laboured not for the Church, but perſecuted it. So <hi>David</hi> aſcended not as the firſt fruits of them that ſlept, but <hi>Christ</hi> aſcended ſo; by vertue of whoſe aſcenſion, <hi>David,</hi> and all the reſt of the faithfull ſhall aſcend. But not to fight with the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow; I take the word at the manifeſt meaning, that <hi>David</hi> is not aſcended: and from thence conclude againſt themſelues; That if
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:107656:139"/>
                           <hi>David</hi> had not aſcended before <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nor yet aſcended with Him, much leſſe were the faithfull ſoules in heaven before <hi>Christ;</hi> but that the ſoule of <hi>David</hi> dwells, and muſt ſtill dwell in Paradiſe with <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the reſt of the faithfull, till the end bee. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.13. But if they will needes have the ſoule of <hi>David</hi> in heaven, not <hi>formaliter,</hi> as all the faithfull ſoules are, in reſpect of the heavenly joyes which they have in Paradiſe; but locally; then (I ſay) it muſt needes have aſcended. For if the ſoule being in one place, is not in another, and if heaven be upward in reſpect of the earth: then when <hi>Dauids</hi> ſoule went into heauen, it muſt needes be ſaid to aſcend, or goe upward, as <hi>Luke</hi> 2.15. ſpeakes of the Angels; and <hi>Solomon, Eccleſ.</hi> 3.21. ſpeaketh of the ſpirit or ſoule. There ore this is but a poore ſhift, ſuch as they muſt needes bee driven unto, that oppoſe the trueth. Yet thus he holds it ſufficient to mocke at the direct word of our Lord, which is, <hi>Iohn</hi> 20.17. <hi>I have not yet aſcended to my Father.</hi> For if He had, then muſt there be two aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſions, as they beleeve; one of the ſoule alone, and another of the body and ſoule together.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Yet it is ſaid, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.2. <hi>I goe to prepare a place for you; And if I goe to prepare a place, I will come againe, and receive you to my ſelfe.</hi> By which it is plaine, that none could goe to heaven before <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord, had gone and prepared a place for them, which was not done before His death and aſcenſion.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Moreover, it is ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.8. the way into the holyeſt of all was not yet open, while the firſt Tabernacle was yet ſtanding. Whereto, if you take that which is <hi>verſe</hi> 24. <hi>Christ</hi> is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are figures of the true, but into heaven it ſelfe, it will bee manifeſt that there was no entrance; as not into the holy of holies, ſo much leſſe into heaven, before that <hi>Christ</hi> by His death had opened it; as our Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth in the hymne of <hi>Ambroſe; When thou haddest overcome the ſharpeneſſe of death, thou didst open the Kingdome of Heaven to all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers.</hi> Whereupon, it muſt neceſſarily follow, that the ſoules of the faithfull were not in heaven properly ſo called, before the death and reſurrection of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

                        <p n="5">5. To this purpoſe you may alſo bring that which is, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4.8. <hi>When Hee aſcended up on high, He led Captivitie captive.</hi> Now what was this captivitie, or multitude of captives?

If the Elect, then it followes neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they were not in heaven before the aſcenſion of <hi>Christ,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you will bring them downe from thence to fetch up <hi>Christ</hi> in triumph; but then had they not beene captives; if already trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing in heaven, then had not the conqueſt of <hi>Christ</hi> over death, and him that had the power of death, beene ſo glorious, if hee had had no captives to lead in triumph. And therefore, <hi>Eſay.</hi> 53.12. after the ſuffering of <hi>Christ,</hi> deſcribes His conqueſt thus; <hi>I will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide Him a portion with the great, and He ſhall divide the ſpoyle with

And ſith the body, went downe to the earth from whence it was, and that they perſwaded themſelves, that every creature might be abundantly happy in that region whereof it was an inhabitant, as being the onely region that was fit for it; therefore they thought that the place of the ſoules reſt, was not farre from the body; and ſo went downe into the earth. And becauſe the ancient Church could not teach the heathen conuerted to God, but by ſuch words and language as they underſtood, and differed not much in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, from that which they themſelues beleeued; therefore were they content to uſe this manner of ſpeech of deſcending to <hi>Hades,</hi> the houſe of <hi>Pluto,</hi> or hell, which the vulgar had been taught by their guides the Philoſophers and Poets. In ſtead of all the reſt, ſee <hi>Plato</hi> in <hi>Phaedone,</hi> and <hi>Virgil. Aeneidos lib.</hi> 6. yet they meant by this deſcent of <hi>Chriſt</hi> into hell, no other thing, but that His ſoule being ſeparate from His body, went into that place where the faithfull ſoules were then at reſt, and in aſſured hope of further joy; But becauſe our Church uſes not the terme deſcending, but tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches her owne children in their owne tongue to confeſſe that <hi>Chriſt went downe to hell, Artic.</hi> 2. <hi>Let us not forſake the law of our mother.

And certainely it muſt needes bee thought a thing either of great obſcurity, or of little neceſſity; wherein our Church (as moſt other) hath not held it fit to make any further declaration. Therefore, though I take liberty to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what the poſſible or moſt likely meaning of the words may be; yet I preſume not to affirme any thing, but with ſubmiſſion to the Churches judgement, when God ſhall vouchſafe further light thereto, to determine according to the Scripture, what is the certaine trueth in this, or any other queſtion of the like doubtfulneſſe.</p>

                           <hi>they came downe to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucia.</hi> Now if the earth and water made one flat ſurface, which ſtretched from one ſide of heaven to the other, as the old fancy was; then could this deſcent of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> meane no other going downe, but under that ſurface. And although ſome of the Fathers were no better Coſmographers, then to thinke thus; yet for the moſt part they were better thewed. But becauſe our faith ſuffers not to put any untrueth in nature, therefore this going down muſt be refuſed.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. But if this globe of the earth bee hollow; then this going downe may be meant (as moſt of the Fathers tooke it) into that hollowneſſe of the earth.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. And that the earth is hollow, both reaſon and authority ſhew it. Authority you have, 4. <hi>Eſdr.</hi> 4.7. where to the queſtion that might be made, How many ſprings are in the beginning of the deepe? the anſwere by the Angel is ſuppoſed to be, I have not as yet gone downe into hell; whereby you ſee that hell, or the place of the dead, was below this earth on which we tread; and that they that died from hence, did all goe thither. This was the opinion of the ancients, both Heathen and Chriſtians, which held the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call deſcent of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and knew the Syſtem of the world.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Had they not reaſon? For neither God, nor Nature His ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, doe ought in vaine, which yet muſt needs be heere, if from the upper face of the earth, to the centre, a diſtance of ſome 3500. miles on every ſide, ſhould be onely an idle loade of earth and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Moreover, the generation of all the Mineralls, which is onely from water ſteamed up in vapour, and congealed by the ſpirits of ſulphur in the metalls; of ſalts in all manner of ſtones; or of the earth it ſelfe, as vitriols and ſuch like; argue both emptineſſe and heat; neither of which can be in a maſſie lumpe of earth and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: See to this purpoſe, <hi>Novum lumen Chemicum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. Beſide this, the huge quantity of vapour ſent out of the earth, and waters for raine and ſnow in the winter time, argues not onely that there is a hollowneſſe of the earth; but likewiſe that there is ſome powerfull principle, for ſending up ſuch waters which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally doe flee from heat, as this macrocoſmicall Sun is for drawing of them upward. For in the Summertime, when our Sun hath moſt ſtrength to exhale thoſe vapours from the earth, and ſea, wee have leaſt raine, and that becauſe that centrall Principle hath then his greateſt declination to the South; whereas in the Winter, when his declination is to us in the North, then is it moſt powerfull to ſend out thoſe vapours on this ſide of the earth, and to cauſe ſo much raine, except ſome violent froſt doe cloſe up the face of the earth, that they cannot get out; which thing is yet further mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, by thoſe boyſterous ſtormes of raine and winde, which happen in thoſe Countreys that are neere to that girdle of the earth, which they call the Equinoctiall line, where the influences doe meete in direct oppoſition.</p>

If no ſuch centrall Principle bee, by whoſe heate and warme vapours the earth is opened; it were impoſſible that any trees, or rootes could continue in life; eſpecially in Countreys that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved above 20. degrees from the Tropicks toward the Poles. For as thoſe vegetables doe live with a meete temper of cold and heate: So where the cold exceeds, there is no poſſibility of their growth, as it appeares in the places of our Whale-fiſhing, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers within 20. degrees of the Pole.

And though many places are growne barren and fruitleſſe for want of husbandry, and eſpecially to proove the juſt indignation of God againſt ſinne, and to manifeſt the trueth of that word, <hi>Curſed is the earth for thy ſake:</hi> Yet to the ſoule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeparate, and ſo without the helpe of the ſences and imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by the light which God hath given to it, able by it ſelfe to ſee what the poſſibilities of the whole creature are, every place is a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radſe; while it conſiders the infinite goodneſſe and power of God in the creature, as well in that which is deprived of the effects thereof, as in that wherein His goodneſſe is ſtill effectuall. For as there be three eſtates of mans being; This of the Warriour, in this life; That after death, of the Conquerour; And the third, after the reſurrection, of the Triumpher: So likewiſe are there three meanes and degrees of His knowledge; One in this life, wherein wee know nothing but by our ſences, from whence the imagination or fantaſie, that <hi>Hevah</hi> the mother of all living, carries unto reaſon
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:107656:142"/>her <hi>Adam,</hi> all the ſpecies or formes of things which ſhee gathers from the ſences. For nothing lives in the underſtanding but by the power of the fantaſie, which becauſe it is falſe, fickle, and will of it ſelfe without reaſon be working upon every object, as the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite is mooved thereby; therefore the reaſon following the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie, is deceived, and not conſtant, and ſo it comes to paſſe, that wee know few things according to the trueth which is in them. But in that ſecond eſtate of man, when the body returnes to the earth, and his ſences, and conſequently his fantaſie doth utterly periſh. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 146.4. Then the ſoule looking on the creature with its owne eyes, ſees the wonderfull bleſſing and goodneſſe whereof man had beene made partaker in the right uſe of the creature, if he had not loſt the knowledge thereof by his ſinne, and returnes to the Author thereof, that praiſe that is due to Him therefore; and acknowledges that ſtate wherein hee lives, out of the proper habitation, to bee the reward of ſinne; yet becauſe it doth evermore enjoy the comforts of God, in a certaine knowledge, and ſome preſent feeling of thoſe joyes whereof it ſhall be fully partaker hereafter, in the perfection of the whole man, and ſees that this ſeparation is but a preparation for a further perfection in that immortall being which is to come; it hath thereby, as it were, a ſeiſure and delivery of thoſe heavenly joyes, which it had here onely in aſſurance of hope, though till the third ſtate it hath not the full poſſeſſion. And although the ſoule of the wicked man views indeed the creature, and knowes now the loſſe of that bleſſing which it might have had in the right uſe thereof; yet becauſe it hath no hope in the life to come, all that knowledge which it hath, is but to ſee further the wretchedneſſe of it ſelfe, and for a foretaſte of that bitter cup of wrath which it muſt drinke, even to the dregs. And this foretaſte is able to make all the creature hell, unto the miſerable ſoule; as the joyes and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of heaven make all places Paradiſe to the faithfull: For the devill was not therefore happy, becauſe hee was in heaven. <hi>Iob</hi> 1.6. and 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.22. nor therefore miſerable, becauſe hee was thruſt out. <hi>Reuel.</hi> 12.9. for not the place, but the holy Spirit of comfort onely, which never leaves the faithfull ſoule. <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.16. gives heauenly happineſſe; as that ſoule which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute thereof, hath hell in it ſelfe, and muſt needs be in hell, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it is.</p>
                        <p>Now as it is moſt certaine, that there is ſuch a meane ſtate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene this of mortality and that of glory; ſo is it moſt reaſonable to thinke, that this is the imployment of the ſoule, at leaſt for a time, before it bee raiſed up with the body in glory. For ſeeing man was therefore ſet in the creature, and therefore indued with a reaſonable ſoule, that he might in the creature behold the Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and goodneſſe of God, and to His praiſe, bee happy in the right uſe thereof; It was neceſſary that He ſhould know the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the poſſibilities thereof: which knowledge, having by
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:107656:142"/>his ſinne debarred himſelfe of, he could not uſe the creature aright, and ſo became mortall. Yet ſeeing it is impoſſible that the ſinne of man ſhould fruſtrate theend of God, but that He ſhould be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by man, whom He hath purpoſed ſo exceedingly to glorifie; therefore in that ſecond eſtate, wherein the ſoule is better fitted to know, as the Angels, by intuition, or view of the creature, onely ſhall that be effected. Moreover, ſeeing our Lord aſcended not to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, before His ſoule was joyned againe to the body; and that it may not reaſonably bee thought, that the ſeruant in his greateſt baſeneſſe, and loweſt eſtate, ſhould have preeminence before his Lord; nor yet, that the ſoule, that moſt active part of man, ſhould be idle: what can the ſoule and underſtanding bee buſied about, but onely in the enquirie of that trueth and wiſedome which God hath manifeſted in the creature?

                        <p>Thus much it was neceſſary to ſpeake concerning the meanes of the ſoules knowledge, while it is in the ſtate of ſeparation from the body. The third manner and degree of the ſoules knowledge by comprehenſion in the morning viſion, is, when the whole man glorified, ſhall ſee the true being of all things in Him that is the cauſe of all; For then ſhall it know as it is knowne, as you may ſee, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12.

                        <p n="4">4. The other kind of deſcent which is in ſtate or manner of being is, when any thing is changed from any eſtate either proper thereto, or elſe appropriate to an eſtate or condition, that is, or ſeemes to be lower, or worſe. Thus our Lord was ſaid to deſcend
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:107656:143"/>or come downe from heaven, when He clouded His Deitie in our humanitie, as I have ſhewed heretofore. Thus alſo He, and all man-kind may be ſaid to deſcend, to be abaſed, or brought low, when the ſoule is parted from the body. For ſeeing both the parts are for the perfection of the whole; the whole muſt needs be more excellent than either of the parts, ſo that the whole being diſſolved, both the parts doe ſuffer hurt or loſſe thereby, eſpecially the ſoule which ſees the loſſe, and findes it ſelfe in a ſtate of being, beſide the end of the creation of it ſelfe, which was to give life unto the body; and this is the cauſe why the ſoule would not bee unclothed, but rather that this mortalitie might bee ſwallowed up of life. And this is the loweſt ſtate of humiliation, whereto the ſoule of our Lord could come naturally, and by this ſtate, ſome will interpret the deſcent into hell, as I ſhewed in the beginning, <hi>Nu.</hi> 2. But if this humiliation muſt meane alſo the ſeparation of the ſoule from the body, while the body was laid in the duſt; it reaches no further than to his death: For a man is not ſaid to bee dead, till his ſoule be departed from his body. But if this ſtate of humiliation be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in that ſence, as ſome doe very fitly interpret it, by that phraſe uſed often in the Scripture, of a mans being gathered unto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming unto that congregation of the ſaints, which had died in the faith of Him that was to come; then taking alſo <gap reason="foreign">

And becauſe this is true, ſafe, and unqueſtionable, it may on all parts be agreed unto (as I ſaid before) and yet the word of deſcending or going downe reſerved to the right meaning, by the abatement or loſſe of that eſtate which the ſoule had with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, in the being of the whole and perfect man. So alſo the queſtion about the place of hell, and Paradiſe, which hath moved moſt doubt herein, by this interpretation is avoyded. But becauſe all this will reach no further than to be perfectly dead, and becauſe the Latine interpretation, <hi>Deſcendit ad inferos,</hi> rendered by our Church, <hi>Hee went downe into hell,</hi> ſuffers us not to ſtay here; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the moſt voices amongſt the Fathers have ſwayed the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to a locall deſcent, and that (as it ſeemes) in the third ſence ſpoken of before, and moſt of all becauſe the holy Scripture binds us thereto; let us follow our beſt and ſureſt guides, and confeſſe with the Prophets and Apoſtles, that the ſoule of our Lord, after His death on the Croſſe, went downe into hell, or the place of the dead, and there continued three dayes and three nights in the heart of the earth, as it was propheſied in the ſigne of <hi>Ionas</hi> the Prophet. <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.40.

And becauſe all the glorious doings and ſufferings of our Saviour were for our uttermoſt benefit, and comfort; therefore is this going downe of His into hell, alſo to give us aſſurance of our full and perfect deliverance from all the powers of death and hell, and reſtoring of all His beleevers unto an immortall life and glory. And becauſe the doctrine of our Church, into which I was bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, bindes me to beleeve that our Lord <hi>Ieſus</hi> after His death, went downe into hell-locally, and that by the authorities of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and becauſe I have before ſhewed that the ſoule of <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not aſcend to heaven before His reſurrection, and have denied alſo that I thinke with them that ſay, that He went downe to ſuffer for our ſinne; And having (as I thinke) ſaid enough to all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinions: the trueth by the Holy Scripture, and the reaſons grounded thereon, muſt be made to appeare. But firſt of all, it is plaine, that the meaning of our Church is ſuch; for in the 8. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle it is ſaid, that the Creed of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ought thorowly to bee
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:107656:144"/>received, and beleeved, and that becauſe it may be prooved by moſt certaine warrants of Holy Scripture. And in the 7. Article, the Church of <hi>Ireland</hi> agreeth hereto in theſe words; <hi>All and every the Articles conteined in the Nicene Creed, the Creed of Athanaſius,</hi> and that which is commonly called the <hi>Apoſtles Creed,</hi> ought firmly to be obſerved and beleeved. For they may bee prooved by moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine warrant of Holy Scripture. And becauſe it may not bee ſuppoſed that our Church cites the authority of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> but according to his owne meaning, as he himſelfe hath explained it; if it were the meaning of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> that <hi>Chriſt</hi> after His ſuffering deſcended locally into the hell of the damned, it muſt needes bee that our Church accorded to his meaning. And what the meaning of this Article in the Creed of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> is, we need not to doubt, who have <hi>Athanaſius</hi> himſelfe to declare it in his Epiſtle of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation of our Lord <hi>Ieſus Christ,</hi> againſt <hi>Apollinarius:</hi> where hee prooves againſt his Hereſie, that there bee onely two parts of the humane nature in <hi>Christ,</hi> a body which the grave received; and a ſoule, which went downe into hell: the grave received that which was bodily, hell that which was not bodily: And by his reaſon you may yet underſtand his meaning better. When the Creator (ſaith he) call'd man into queſtion for his diſobedience, Hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed againſt him a double puniſhment; For to the body He ſaid, <hi>Thou art earth, and unto earth thou ſhalt returne:</hi> But to the ſoule He ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt die the death:</hi> And for this cauſe, man being dead, is condemned to depart to two places; And therefore it was alſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that the Iudge Himſelfe that made this decree ſhould alſo undergoe it, that in the eſtate of man condemned, ſhewing Himſelfe free from ſin, &amp; uncondemned, He might reconcile man unto God, and reſtore him to perfect libertie. In the ſame Epiſtle, hee had ſaid a little before, that in hell He condemned death, that Hee might every way perfect the ſalvation of man in our image, which He had put on; and in his fourth oration againſt the <hi>Arians,</hi> hee ſaith, that the powers of hell withdrew themſelues, being afraid at the ſight of <hi>Christ.</hi> So the meaning of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> is plaine, that the ſoule of <hi>Christ</hi> did locally goe downe to hell: and withall the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our Church. Now among theſe texts of Scripture, by which this doctrine of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> may bee warranted, that text of the 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18.19. is moſt plaine, eſpecially as it ſtands in the <hi>Greeke.

And although I deny not that the ſence is true and good, <hi>He was quickned by the Spirit,</hi> that holy Spirit which Hee received not by meaſure; yet I hold that this is not the native meaning of this place, and the beſt printed copies of <hi>Stephan Plantin</hi> and others, are with me: Neither will the words naturally beare that change of <hi>In</hi> and <hi>By;</hi> Neither did the reverend <hi>Noel,</hi> Deane of <hi>Pauls,</hi> and other like Him, accord with them.

And ſeeing our Lord <hi>Christ</hi> is appointed of God to bee the Iudge of the world, and that as He is the Sonne of man, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that our Lord ſhould goe downe to hell, both in regard of the juſtice, and of the mercy which ought to appeare in His judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; of His juſtice, that the enemies of mankind, the devills, may not torment them according to their cruelty and hatred of man, but onely in juſtice afflict them, according to the ſentence paſſed on them, according to the meaſure of their ſinne, and not beyond, as it is ſaid, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.47, and 48. <hi>The ſervant which knew his masters will and prepared not himſelfe, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes, but hee that knew it not, ſhall be beaten with fewer.</hi>

                        <p n="4">4. And becauſe our Lord <hi>Christ</hi> was by the Father appointed to be the Saviour of mankind, it was neceſſary that His compaſſion toward mankind, ſhould by all meanes be inflamed, and therefore that His ſoule ſhould goe downe to hell; that as by the bodily fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of our miſeries in this life, He was made a mercifull and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full high-Prieſt for us. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.7. ſo by the actuall and preſent ſight of thoſe unſufferable torments, He might have the uttermoſt mercy and compaſſion which can ſtand with juſtice, on thoſe whom Hee ſhould judge.</p>

It is neceſſary for our Redeemer to paſſe thorow fire and water, that is, to have experience of all tentations and all manner of afflictions, of death and hell, that for us He might overcome them all. But He that was the paterne of all Heroicall and excellent vertues, that knew Himſelfe to have come into the world, that He ſhould die that ſhamefull death of the Croſſe, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.14. and 12.33. was not ſo affrighted at the bodily death, but His ſtrong crying and teares, were, <hi>That the pit of hell ſhould not ſwallow Him up, nor that deepe ſhould ſhut her mouth upon Him.

And firſt I put this as granted, That as the Articles themſelves, ſo their interpretation muſt bee ſuch as muſt ſtand in the greateſt evidence and declaration of the trueth; in greateſt oppoſition to falſhood, and hereſie, and for the higheſt hope and comfort of the faithfull.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Now if you follow the interpretation of the Fathers, that the ſoule of Chriſt, after death, aſcended locally or really to hell, or the place of them that had died in the hope of the deliverer that was to come, then it followes neceſſarily, that the ſoule of <hi>Chriſt</hi> had a being, ſeparate and apart from the body, and that it was therefore an immortall ſoule, that died not with the body, being able to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of it ſelfe without the body. Whereby the hereſie of the <hi>Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces,</hi> which deny the being of ſpirits and ſoules ſeparate, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the immortality of the ſoule, and thereupon the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection alſo <hi>Mark.</hi> 12.18. <hi>Act.</hi> 23.7. is plainely refuted. And ſo that lie of the <hi>Thnatopſychitae,</hi> which thought that the ſoule of man came to nought, as the ſoules of the beaſts; and no leſſe, that opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Apollinarius,</hi> That <hi>Chriſt</hi> tooke of His mother, a vegetable, but not a reaſonable ſoule; all which you ſee make the death of <hi>Christ,</hi> and our faith in Him, of none effect. But if that interpretation be onely true, That <hi>Chriſt</hi> being yet alive, ſuffered helliſh torments in His ſoule; are any of theſe falſhoods refuted thereby? doth it from thence follow againſt the <hi>Sadduces, ergo,</hi> the ſoule of <hi>Christ</hi> is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall? he will deny the conſequence, he will yeeld, it might ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in His body; but that it died with His body, or againſt the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollinarists,</hi> therefore <hi>Christ</hi> had a perfect humane ſoule; hee will deny it: For although he yeeld that the ſoule of <hi>Christ</hi> ſuffered ſuch torments; yet he will ſay, That it was onely by a vegetable or animall ſoule, which ſuffered by compaſſion with the body.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. But becauſe the hereſie of <hi>Arius</hi> did trouble the Church, more then any ancient hereſie beſide; Let us ſee what force our bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery hath againſt his fortifications. The ſoule of <hi>Christ</hi> went downe to hell locally, to the ſoules of other men; therefore <hi>Christ</hi> had a ſoule like other men. They will anſwere here, That His created Deity, which they falſly imagined, went downe to the places under the earth. (For ſo they explaine it out of <hi>Iob</hi> 38.17 as you may ſee, <hi>Anſwer: to the Ieſ: Chal: pag.</hi> 282. But that anſwere will not ſerue. For though it were a created Deity, yet being a Deity, it
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:107656:146"/>muſt have thoſe conditions of omnipotencie in the creature, of ubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, wiſedome, &amp;c. without which it could not be a Deitie. So then that created Deitie of <hi>Christ</hi> muſt bee in hell before the death of <hi>Christ,</hi> as well as after, and thoſe helliſh torments of the new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters, which ſay nothing of the ſtate of <hi>Christs</hi> humane ſoule, after His death, availe nothing to the contrary of this hereſie.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Neither doth this new interpretation onely diſmount our artillery againſt thoſe ancient hereſies, but alſo diſmantles our fort of that refuge and ſuccour which the diſtreſſed ſoule may have in the agonies of death. For bee it put that our Saviour tooke our ſinnes upon Him, and felt in Himſelfe the fierce wrath of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Him, ſo as if He had committed the ſinnes of all men; I finde therefore that God doth not deale with me according to my ſinnes, nor reward me according to mine iniquities. And bee it, that being dead, His body was buryed in the grave; I will therefore ſay unto my grave, <hi>O ſweete bed of reſt, that waſt ſo perfumed with the odours of His moſt pretious Merits!</hi> But when I ſee my ſoule all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leprous with originall ſinne, and ſpotted like a <hi>Panther</hi> with actuall tranſgreſſions, now going to a place that it doth not know, and of which I have no aſſurance that He hath beene there, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the power thereof; then death, which was hoped to bee the reſt from the ſorrowes and troubles of this life, becomes the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of feare and doubt. For though I know my debt was pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon His Croſſe; yet the Priſoner is not ſet at libertie, till ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction be acknowledged, and the diſcharge entered in the Booke. But being fully perſwaded that my Redeemer hath broken thoſe brazen gates, and hewed the barres of Iron aſunder, and hath there ſet up the Trophie of His conqueſt on high, then the life, cheereful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and vigor of faith is ſtrong, becauſe I know that as hell had no power to hold Him; ſo hath it no power of any of His; becauſe His promiſe is, that the gates of Hell ſhall not prevaile againſt his Church, and that the Prince of this World hath nothing in Him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.30. He ſpeaketh not of His naturall, but of His myſticall body: ſo that every member thereof may ſay with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Pſal.</hi> 13.8. <hi>Though I make my bed in hell, Thou art there; there ſhall the wings of thy protection cover mee, and I ſhall be ſafe under thy feathers.</hi> For as thou haſt died for me; ſo haſt thou gone downe to hell, for me, to ſpoile the powers therof, that Thy <hi>Euridice</hi> may follow thee from thence, without any feare of turning back againe.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Moreover, if it were neceſſary in the Articles of our Faith, to bind us to beleeve that His body was buryed, is it not much more neceſſary to know what became of His ſoule, eſpecially ſeeing the redemption of our ſoules, and the freedome of them from hell, doth much more concerne us, and hath much more comfort therein, then to be aſſured that our bodies ſhall reſt in hope? Skin for Skin, and all that a man hath, will he give for his life, and ten bodyes would he forſake, that his ſoule might bee partaker of eternall life. But
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:107656:146"/>when the ſumme of our faith helpes us to give no reckoning what became of the ſoule of our Saviour, more than this, that it was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with helliſh torments while He was alive, wee cannot ſay of our owne ſoules, whether they die or ſleepe, (as ſome have dreamed) till the reſurrection; Therefore having confeſſed Him to bee dead, that is, His ſoule to have departed from His body; His body to have beene laid in the grave; let us alſo beleeve as we confeſſe, that His ſoule went down into hel, which none but an Infidell will deny.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. For the greateſt benefit and deliverance, the greateſt glory and thankes are due to God, which the creature is able to give. But the greatneſſe of the deliverance is not knowne to man, but by the danger which hee hath eſcaped. Therefore that man may bee truely humbled, and truely thankfull to God therefore; it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that hee doe know what that vengeance and wrath of God againſt ſin is, and what that puniſhment which is due thereunto, which he cannot doe but by the true ſight and knowledge of that puniſhment; which cannot be poſſibly in this life, wherein we know nothing but by the ſence. Therefore as it is neceſſary, that man doe know in the ſtate after this life, what the torments and paines of hell are, by the true ſight, and perfect knowledge thereof, that is, in his ſpirit and underſtanding, which with the acknowledgment of hell as his due, is that actuall deſcent unto hell, whereto every man is bound, ſo for the aſſurance of our hope, is it alwayes neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to know, that our ranſome from thence was wrought and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted by the moſt certain proofe and declaration that might be, which could not bee by any meſſenger, or tidings, but by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence alone of Him that wrought it. For as it had bin of no availe for our Lord to have gone to hell, before the ſatisfaction for ſinne was made, ſo being made and manifeſted unto the powers of hell, it was not poſſible, but that it ſhould bee available for all them for whom it was made. And thus was that fulfilled, which in <hi>Hoſea</hi> 13.14. <hi>O death, I will be thy plagues, O [ſheol] hell, I will be thy destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: repentance is hid from mine eyes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. As it is impoſſible that the end of all the ſufferings of our <hi>Lord</hi> ſhould not follow, when all thoſe things were performed which were for the effecting of the end; which was the delivery of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers from the power of death: ſo was it impoſſible that the end ſhould follow, till all things were performed that were for the end. For ſo ſome of the meanes had bin ordained in vaine. But that is impoſſible, for <hi>His worke is before Him,</hi> ſo that He leaveth nothing without the perfect accompliſhment. Therefore it was neceſſary that as our Lord had redeemed us by His death, ſo He ſhould alſo goe downe to hell for the delivery of His captives,<note n="*" place="margin">

Now if the ſoule of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour had not gone downe to them, then had He not beene made like to His brethren in all things except their ſinne: Then had He not bin ſubject to the decree of God upon all mankind. Then had not His love to man-kind bin perfected, that having payd their ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, would not ſee them ſet at libertie, without which the merit of His ſatisfaction had bin in vaine. But all theſe things are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. And therefore our Redeemer did really and actually goe downe to hell, or the place of the beleevers being dead; that Hee might free them from the power of death, as by the vertue of the eternall offering of Himſelfe, He had preſerved them from the hell of the damned.</p>
                        <p>Thus according to the meaning of the Church of <hi>England</hi> (as far as I underſtand it) have I faithfully declared, and proved the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Article. That our Lord after his death, as concerning His ſoule, went downe into hell; and that not onely becauſe I was baptized into this faith, as this Church doth hold and profeſſe it: But alſo becauſe I know that this Church, holy, and beloved of her Lord, is faithfull unto Him, and to Him alone: For though ſhe hold other Churches her ſiſters, called, faithfull, and beloved; and eſteemes of their true Paſtors and Doctors as beautifull and ſhining lights: yet followes ſhee nothing of any mans, becauſe it is his; whether <hi>Luther,</hi> or <hi>Calvin,</hi> or any other: but <hi>Christ</hi> her Lord alone doth ſhe follow, according to his owne rule, <hi>My ſheepe heare my voice,</hi> a ſtranger will they not follow, for they know not the voice of ſtrangers. But therfore as I ſaid before, ſo doe I ſtill profeſſe that of this Church upon any light from God, ſhall hereafter declare the meaning of this Article otherwayes than I have done; I forſake my ſelfe to follow her, ſo far as ſhe ſhall follow <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And if any faithfull man be otherwiſe minded concerning the meaning of this Article, then I have ſhewed: yet doe not I therefore hold him of another Church or faith, ſo long as he doth hold faſt the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>one God, and one Mediator betweene God and man, the man Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> For the Kingdome of God is not in the excellency of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; much leſſe in wilfulneſſe of opinion in matier of doubt: but in joy, and peace, and comfort of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> while a man doth thoſe things which he knowes in himſelfe, he is bound to performe.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ſufferings of <hi>Christ</hi> were fulfilled, as wee have ſeene: now it followes that wee ſee the glories that ſhould follow after, of which, the firſt is His triumph over death, by His reſurrection from the dead, ſet againſt that in the Article be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Hee was dead and buried.</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though by His death, He is ſaid to have triumphed over the principalities and powers of death and hell, in His Croſſe. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. that is, by the power and vertue of His merit, as a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion by His valour and courage in the field, overcame His enemie: yet the actuall manifeſtation of His triumph, was not ſolemnized, till by His reſurrection, the power and glory of His victory did appeare. But it may here be asked, How <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord is ſaid to have riſen againe, ſeeing Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. <hi>That Hee was rayſed againe by the glory of the Father?</hi> To which the anſwere is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily returned, that <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord by His owne active power, as He was God, raiſed Himſelfe from the dead: and as man, by a paſſive or received power was raiſed againe, as He ſaid of Himſelfe, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.18. <hi>I have power to lay downe my life of my ſelfe, and I have power to take it up againe. This commandement have I received from my Father.</hi> For, for this end was it neceſſary that our Mediatour
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:107656:148"/>ſhould be both God and man in one Perſon, that that which was not fit, nor poſſible for the God-head, might bee endured in the humanity, as thoſe things which concerned His death and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: and that which was impoſſible to His pure humanity, might yet therein be perfected by His divinitie, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.3.4. <hi>that He was made of the ſeed of David according to the fleſh, and declared to bee the Sonne of God by His reſurrection from the dead.</hi> But there is a great difference betweene the ſtate or manner of His be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before His death, and after His reſurrection. For although the unitie of the humanitie with the God-head, were alwayes before, in, and after His death the ſame: yet was not that unitie alwayes manifeſted in the ſame glory and excellency. For in the firſt ſtate, while He bare our infirmities, His body was ſubiect to hunger, cold, wearineſſe, death, and other accidents of a naturall body, His ſoule alſo, though according to the principall, or firſt acts endued with the excellencie of reaſon and knowledge; yet according to the ſecond acts or practiſe, not knowing the grave of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> the day of Iudgement, &amp;c. In the ſecond ſtate alſo, His body was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of ſence and life, His ſoule of the proper habitation. But in His reſurrection, His body was rayſed immortall, ſpirituall, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.44.45. <hi>glorious, and as in al the perfection of grace and compaſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on us; ſo with the fulneſſe of Wiſedome and Knowledge to ſee our miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and to make interceſSion for us, according to the will of God. Rom.</hi> 8.26, 27.</p>
                        <p>Now concerning the trueth of this Article, <hi>that our Lord Ieſus roſe againe from the dead,</hi> though it be moſt powerfully witneſſed, by God Himſelfe, by Angels, and men, as you may read: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the authoritie of the Scriptures wherin thoſe things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, is ſet at nought by <hi>Iewes, Turkes, Infidels, Hereticks,</hi> and ſuch God leſſe people: let not us endeavour to leade them like ſheepe that follow their ſhepherd, but drive them like aſſes with the cudgell of reaſon. And as Saint <hi>Peter, Actes</hi> 2.24. takes his firſt argument from the impoſſibility of not performing thoſe things which are contained in the Scripture; ſo our arguments ſhall be from the impoſſibilities in reaſon.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It hath been prooved before, that man was created innocent, <hi>Chapter</hi> 15. That by his ſinne he became ſubiect to death, <hi>Chapter</hi> 16. That there is a reſtoring to a better eſtate, <hi>Chapter</hi> 18. And that the reſtorer of mankind muſt be both God and man, <hi>Chapter</hi> 20. and 21. Then, that this reſtorer was <hi>Ieſus</hi> our Lord, the Sonne of the Virgin <hi>Mary, Chapter</hi> 24. who by His ſufferings and death, made ſatisfaction for the ſinnes of the world. Whence I argue thus. For the greateſt good that can be done for mankind, the greateſt ill may not be rewarded, for that were unjuſt with God. The greateſt good that could come to mankind, was the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoming of man from eternall death both of the body and ſoule. The greateſt ill and baſeneſſe, is to be left continually in the ſtate
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:107656:148"/>of death; wherein if <hi>Christ</hi> had ſtill continued, then had He ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the greateſt ill, for the greateſt good which could bee perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. But this was impoſſible: Therefore our Lord did riſe againe from the dead.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who ſinned not, ſhould have borne the puniſhment of ſinne, that is, to be ſubject to the power of death; yea, when the ſatisfaction was fully ended, then ſhould His obedience to God the Father, have beene not onely without reward, but alſo for the ſatisfaction of the juſtice God, had He ſuffered from God (I ſpeake after the manner of men) extreame injuſtice, who had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſinne of His owne, for which He ſhould ſuffer, and had fully ſatisfied for their ſinnes whoſe ſurety He was. But this was utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impoſſible; <hi>For he that fulfilleth the Law, ſhall live therein. Levit.</hi> 18.5. ergo, <hi>It was neceſſary, that Chriſt having fulfilled the Law, Iohn</hi> 19.30. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.44. <hi>ſhould riſe againe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. If <hi>Chriſt</hi> after His ſuffering and death had not riſen againe, then had He not prooved Himſelfe to be the Saviour of the world; ſeeing none would have beleeved Him to be able, to give life unto others, that was not able to quicken Himſelfe: So His ſuffering had beene in vaine, and His ſatisfaction, if not beleeved, ſhould have beene to no purpoſe: So His greateſt and beſt worke had effected no good to us, but a perpetuall ill unto Himſelfe. But all theſe things were impoſſible. Therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord did riſe againe.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. It is impoſſible but that where the greateſt union is, there ſhould be the greateſt love and conſent. The greateſt union that may be, is in our Mediator, ſeeing the humane nature is ſuſtained in the Perſon of the Deity. But the ſoule of <hi>Chriſt</hi> being ſeparate, did naturally deſire to bee united to the body; for otherwayes ſhould it not have deſired the perfection of it ſelfe, that is, to give life and ſence, and to be one with that body which was peculiar to it ſelfe, as the deſire of all humane ſoules is, and therefore depart ſo unwillingly from the body. But if this were the naturall deſire of the ſoule, no way ſinfull, the Deity infinite in power, and in regard of the unity conſenting thereto; it muſt follow of neceſſity that our Lord was raiſed againe from the dead.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Contrary cauſes muſt have contrary effects. The devill, by the ſinne which he wrought in <hi>Adam,</hi> had cauſed death to prevaile over life in all mankind. Therefore <hi>Christ,</hi> who came to deſtroy the workes of the deuill, muſt cauſe life to prevaile over death. But this could not be done in the members, before it was perfected in the head. Therefore <hi>Christ</hi> being dead, muſt of neceſſity bee the firſt fruits of them that are raiſed from the dead. And if it were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that <hi>Christ</hi> ſhould firſt riſe; <hi>Ergo,</hi> it was impoſſible that He ſhould not riſe. <hi>See Log: chap.</hi> 26.11.1.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. If <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord had not beene raiſed from death, <hi>(a)</hi> then had it beene impoſſible that any of His beleevers ſhould bee raiſed
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:107656:149"/>againe by the power and merit of His reſurrection. 1. And ſo the naturall deſire of the ſoule to dwell with the body, ſhould be created in vaine: 2. So the debt being paid, the priſoner ſhould ever be detained: 3. So the afflictions of the Saints, which they have ſuffered in body, ſhould be in vaine, as cold, hunger, nakedneſſe, reproach and ſhame, impriſonment, ſtripes, yea, and death it ſelfe willingly ſuſtained for the love of God, ſhould be without reward. But it were againſt the juſtice of God, to cauſe the body and ſoule to ſuffer together, and not to glorifie them both together: 4. So alſo the death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould not be meritorious and effectuall for the procuring of all that good which might and ought to come thereby, both to Himſelfe and all His beleevers; For although the ſoules of the faithfull, for the merit and full ſatisfactions ſake of His death, being ſeparate, might enjoy an eternall, though not a full happineſſe without the body, yet the body ſhould be left eternally to the power of death, and ſo the workes of the devill ſhould not be deſtroyed by <hi>Chriſt:</hi> 5. So alſo the body ſhould be created in vaine, if to ſorrow onely, without the hope of happineſſe: 6. So God ſhould loſe His right in His creature, if Hee were not Lord both of the living and of the dead, both of the ſoule and of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: 7. So the one ſinne and diſobedience of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſhould be more powerfull to condemne mankind, then the everlaſting and moſt perfect obedience of the Sonne of God ſhould be to ſave it. But all theſe things are impoſſible; And therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. <hi>That Chriſt was delivered to death for our ſinne, and raiſed againe for our Iuſtification. For if Christ be not raiſed againe, then are we yet in our ſinnes.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.17. not that any addition was made by His reſurrection, to that ſatisfaction which He made by His death: but becauſe the reſurrection of <hi>Christ</hi> is a ſure and manifeſt proofe of His conqueſt over ſinne, death, hell, and all the power of the devill: and that His ſuffering and death was a full and ſufficient ſacrifice, whereby the wrath of God, againſt ſinne, was fully ſatisfied, ſo that we are now juſtified in His ſight: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, if in the conflict of our Redeemer with death and hell, He had been overcome, then could we have had no faith nor hope, that our ſinne by His death had beene done away. But now knowing that He hath overcome death and is returned to life againe, in all the troubles and ſorrowes of this life and in the agonies of death, wee may be ſecure; as the feet or toes that are loweſt under the water, may hope at laſt to come to land, becauſe they know that their head being above the water, the body cannot be drowned.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Now concerning that impoſſibility of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> it ſtands thus. It is impoſſible that the Scripture, being the declaration of Gods trueth, made by Himſelfe, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. ſhould faile. But it hath beene declared by the Scripture, that <hi>Christ</hi> ſhould be raiſed againe from the dead: Therefore it was impoſſible that He ſhould ſtill be held under the power of death.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:107656:149"/>The text cited by Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> is found <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.10. to which you may adde the types of the old Teſtament, whereby the death and reſurrection of our Lord was ſignified, as that of <hi>Noah, Gen.</hi> 9. <hi>ver.</hi> 20. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When our Saviour, being as it were drunken with the love of His Church and deſire of mans ſalvation, tooke our ſtate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Him, and for us became ſubject to the death of the Croſſe; when being ſeene by the <hi>Iewes,</hi> thoſe <hi>Chumits,</hi> in the nakedneſſe or infirmity of our eſtate, He was ſet at nought by them that thought that their <hi>Meſsiah</hi> could not die. <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.34. But when <hi>Noah</hi> our Reſt and Comforter awaked out of His grave, He brought on them, that deſtruction which was foretold, as the puniſhment of their hardneſſe of heart and unbeliefe. <hi>See Pſalm.</hi> 41.10. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.26. So the Ram taken by his hornes in the buſh, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. was the type of His death; and <hi>Iſaac</hi> taken alive from the Altar, the figure of His reſurrection: <hi>Ioſeph</hi> alſo taken out of the dungeon, to be ruler over all the land of <hi>Egypt.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe was the law of the two goates, <hi>Levit.</hi> 6. the one ſlaine for a ſinne offering, the other ſent alive into a land of ſeparation, to make an atonement for all iniquity, tranſgreſſions and ſinne of the people. So by the two Sparrowes, <hi>Levit.</hi> 14. He that was like to the ſolitary ſparrow on the houſe top, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 102.7. ſhed His blood for the cleanſing of our leproſie; yet by the other that was ſent alive into the open ayre, His reſurrection was figured. <hi>Sampſon</hi> the <hi>Nazarite</hi> aſleepe in <hi>Gaza,</hi> ſignified our Lord in the ſleepe of death for the love of His Church; yet waking, and having opened the gates of death, He carryed them away, and aſcended in triumph to the top of the mount. <hi>Iudg.</hi> 16.3. And becauſe the ſtrong gates of death are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed away, we are aſſured that all they that ſleepe in the duſt of death ſhall riſe to give an account of their workes. Beſide theſe types, you have alſo the prophecies of the old Teſtament, as <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 68.20. <hi>That to Him belonged the iſſues of death,</hi> both to paſſE out of death Himſelfe, and alſo to bring out His from thence. <hi>Eſay</hi> alſo <hi>Chap.</hi> 53. after He had declared His ſufferings and death, proves His reſurrection by His dividing the ſpoile with the ſtrong. Our Lord alſo foretold His reſurrection Himſelfe, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.49. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.33. and the <hi>(b)</hi> infidelity of <hi>Thomas</hi> made it certaine unto all. Vpon all which texts, we may firmely conclude with Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> that it was impoſſible that our Lord ſhould be held in the bands of death.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. And why the third day was appointed for His reſurrection, a reaſon or two are rendered. Hee roſe not before, that none might doubt but that He was certainely dead: <hi>See the</hi> 27. <hi>chap. for His death and buriall:</hi> Neither was it fit to deferre the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection longer, leſt the faith and hope of His Diſciples ſhould faile, <hi>Who truſted that it was Hee that ſhould have redeemed Iſrael.

                              <hi>(b) The infidelitie of Thomas made it certaine unto all.</hi> God that brings light out of darkneſſe, uſed the unbeliefe of <hi>Thomas</hi> for a moſt evident proofe of the reſurrection of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> ſo that although he would not beleeve the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of ſo many witneſſes as had ſeene him alive; yet his owne tryalls according to his owne manner of proofe, by his finger put into the print of the nayles, and his hand thruſt in his ſide, might make him to beleeve; yet was nothing of all this of any availe to them that are without. For as <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> not obſcurely ſignifies, <hi>Haer.</hi> 28. and <hi>Aug. De Haer. cap.</hi> 8. directly affirmes, <hi>Cerinthus</hi> that Hereticke, and his followers, taught that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was onely man, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that He was not yet riſen from the dead. But both the propoſition, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.55. and the concluſion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. from <hi>verſe</hi> 11. to 16. were made by the blind-hearted <hi>Iewes,</hi> before our <hi>Lords</hi> aſcenſion, and ſtill is it their errour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this day. But if no man could doe thoſe miracles that He did, except God were with Him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.2. If God alone doth know the heart; If God alone can forgive ſinnes, <hi>Mark.</hi> 2.7, 8. then their ſeared conſciences were bound by their owne words to acknowledge, that He was God: Yet becauſe they ever reſiſted the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt, Actes</hi> 7.51. that their concluſion might ſtand, <hi>that He was not riſen from the dead;</hi> therefore with large money hyred they the Souldiers, that had watched, knowne well to bee takers, that they ſhould ſay, that His Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples had ſtollen Him away, while they ſlept. But this foule lie ſtinks to him that hath but halfe a noſe: 1. For if they ſlept indeed, how could they ſay, His Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples ſtole Him, rather then that Hee roſe againe of Himſelfe? 2. Beſides when the Diſciples themſelves did not beleeve, nor when they heard it, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that it was poſsible that He ſhould riſe againe, <hi>Mark.</hi> 9.10. and 31. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.34. no, nor yet after it was come to paſſe, could they beleeve them that had ſeene Him. <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.11. and 13. to what end ſhould they be the auctors of ſuch a device? 3. Moreover all other circumſtances are againſt it: For if they had ſtol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Him away, wherefore ſhould they offer themſelves the ſecond time to a needleſſe danger, as you reade, <hi>Iohn</hi> 20.4. &amp;c. 4. Wherefore left they the fine linnen wherein He was wrapped; which either reſpect to the corpes, or cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, or haſte, or feare of the ſouldiers, or all together, would not have given them time to plucke off, when all places were full of feare, the earth it ſelfe trembling and quaking, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.2. 5. Beſide all this, the Prieſts having ſuch power of themſelves, ſuch favour from <hi>Pilate,</hi> why did they not call the Apoſtles in queſtion for the fact? That the whole trueth, (if it were as they ſaid) might have appeared, and would eaſily by their wit and greatneſſe, have beene fiſh't out of filly fiſhers, if they ſhould have gone about to conceale it? But—<hi>male verum examinat omnis Corruptus Iudex</hi>—And becauſe they knew well enough, that by their further queſtioning, the trueth of God, and their lie, would bee manifeſt to all; therefore neither then, nor at any time afterward, durſt they endeavour to diſproove this trueth, to which, God Himſelfe with ſo great power of miracles and wonders, and gifts of the

                        <p>§ 1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough the Iuſtification of the Articles of our Creed bee my onely worke: Yet heere I heare two queſtions demanded of mee. The firſt, who thoſe were which are ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.52. and 53. to have riſen at the reſurrection of <hi>Christ,</hi> and to have ſhewed themſelues to many in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem?</hi> The ſecond, where our Lord was in that time of 40. dayes, betweene His reſurrection and aſcenſion; ſeeing it is manifeſt that He converſed not wholely with His Diſciples, but ſhewed Himſelfe unto them at ſeverall times, and that eſpecially on the firſt dayes of the weeke, as on that day He had riſen from the dead. To theſe I anſwere, where I have the authority of the Scripture, boldly: where I have not, I leave you at your libertie to thinke with mee: Firſt therefore in the number of them that roſe immediately after the reſurrection of our <hi>Lord,</hi> I put thoſe high Saints which are reckoned in the Genealogie of our <hi>Lord,</hi> from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> unto <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> His nurſing Father, except <hi>Henoch,</hi> and with them many of the Saints, who had ſlept in the faith of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to come in the memory and knowledge of ſuch as were yet alive in <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> as <hi>Zechary,</hi> and <hi>elizabeth, Simeon, Hanna,</hi> and many others, who by ſpeciall grace were rayſed againe, ſhewed themſelues alive unto ſuch as were appointed thereto, and to them bare witneſſe, not onely of the reſurrection of <hi>Christ,</hi> but by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in themſelues, did alſo teſtifie, that the power and vertue of His Reſurrection was of force and availe for the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:107656:152"/>raiſing up of all them that ſhould beleeue in Him. And of theſe, eſpecially, you muſt underſtand that ſpeech of our Lord, which is <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. <hi>Chapter</hi> from verſe 19. to 30, where He ſaith that the houre was comming, and was even then at hand, when the dead ſhould heare the voice of the Sonne of God, and ſhould live. As you may remember how it was ſaid, <hi>Note (a) on the laſt Chapter,</hi> that the faithfull are raiſed by the vertue of <hi>Christs</hi> reſurrection, but they that ſhall be raiſed up to judgement at the laſt day are raiſed up by the power of the Father: Of theſe faithfull that had dyed, was that word of our Saviour ſpoken, as it is manifeſt by the text. And this is that captivitie or number of Captives, which till then had beene held under the bands of death, but by the victory of <hi>Chriſts</hi> reſurrection, were freed from death, and aſcended with Him on high, when Hee gave gifts unto men. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſome will needes interpret that reſurrection only of a new life, by repentance from dead workes; yet the arguments in that place, will not ſo hold. All that are in the graves ſhall heare the voyce of the Father, and ſhall come foorth, ſome to life, ſome to damnation, <hi>ver.</hi> 28.29. Therfore ſome ſhall heare the voice of the Sonne, and live, <hi>verſe</hi> 25. For the Father quickneth the dead; ſo the Sonne, <hi>verſe</hi> 21. And whatſoever the Father doth, the ſame things doth the Sonne likewiſe. But to raiſe the dead, and to give Repentance, are not the ſame things: So then that which is heere ſpoken by our Lord, is no other thing, than that which was propheſied by <hi>Hoſea</hi> 6.2. <hi>The third day He will raiſe us up, and wee ſhall live in His ſight:</hi> and was here fulfilled by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the Evangeliſts. And if the firſt fruits be holy, then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the whole lumpe. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.16. So that we which have the ſame faith, ſhall at laſt receive the end of our hopes, and have our parts in that holy reſurrection, whereof whoſoever is partaker, on Him the ſecond death can have no power. For as that propheſie of <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.18. was fulfilled in part, after the aſcenſion of our Saviour, <hi>It ſhall be in the latter dayes that I will powre out of my Spirit upon all fleſh, &amp;c. Act.</hi> 2.17. and for a proofe or aſſurance of that which ſhall be fulfilled, not in 120. Perſons, but in all fleſh, when the earth ſhall be filled with the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the ſea. <hi>Eſ:</hi> 11.9. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.14. So likewiſe was that reſurrection a pledge and aſſurance of that holy reſurrection of the dead in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which ſhall riſe firſt. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.23. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.16. but the reſt of the dead ſhall not riſe till the time be fulfilled that they ſhall be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to thoſe things that are written in the bookes. <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.4.5.12. Whereas of theſe it is ſaid, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.24. <hi>That they ſhall not come</hi>

                        <p>Now for the ſecond queſtion, although it ſeeme more curious then profitable, to aske where our Saviour was after the time of His reſurrection, during His abſence from His Diſciples; yet I will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere what I thinke, and leave you upon better conſideration to give a better anſwere. Firſt therefore it is manifeſt by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that our Lord ſhewed Himſelfe Eleven times after His reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; if oftner, yet is it not manifeſt by the text. Of this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber five manifeſtations of Himſelfe were on the day of His reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. 1. To <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> alone, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.9. 2. To her againe, and the other <hi>Mary, Mat.</hi> 28.9. 3. To <hi>Simon Peter, Luke</hi> 24.34. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.5. 4. To <hi>Cleopas,</hi> and his friend, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.15.35. 5. To all the Apoſtles, except <hi>Thomas, Iohn</hi> 20.24. to which, if you put that time when He aſcended on the 40. day, from mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> the five appearances remaining (for I ſpeake not of thoſe extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary manifeſtations of Himſelfe after His aſcenſion to <hi>Steven, Actes</hi> 7.56. and to <hi>Paul, Actes</hi> 9.17. and 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.8.) will bee moſt likely to have beene on thoſe five <hi>Sundayes</hi> (as wee call them) which were betweene, as it may well be gathered from <hi>Iohn</hi> 20.26. becauſe the Lord would fully finiſh the ceremoniall uſe of the <hi>Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Sabbath, and ſanctifie the day of His reſurrection, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of thoſe benefits which wee receive thereby. This uſe the Primitive Church made of it, <hi>Iust. Mart. Apol. ad Anton.</hi> and further (againſt our <hi>Traskits</hi>) becauſe they would prevent their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, who under the profeſſion of Chriſtianity did ſtill retaine their Iudaiſme; whoſe folly to avoid, in ſtead of the Iewiſh Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, they celebrated the day of <hi>Chriſts</hi> reſurrection <hi>Ign: ep. ad Mag:</hi> Theſe times of ſhewing himſelfe were. 1. To the Diſciples, and <hi>Thomas</hi> with them. <hi>Iohn</hi> 20.26. 2. At the Sea of <hi>Tiberias. Iohn</hi> 21.1.3. 3. On a mountaine of <hi>Galilee</hi> appointed to them. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.16. 4. To above 500. brethren at once. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.6. 5. To <hi>Iames. ver.</hi> 7. And for the times of His abſence from them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſaid in the text to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> cited above, <hi>That He did therefore deſcend into the lower parts of the earth, and aſcend farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all heavens, that He might fill, or fulfill, all things which were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of Him,</hi> not onely thoſe which were neceſſary for our ſaluation, as His Suffering, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, &amp;c. but alſo whatſoever belonged unto man to doe in that ſtate betweene His reſurrection and aſcenſion, as you may in part underſtand by that which hath been ſaid, <hi>Chapter</hi> 28. <hi>N.</hi> I thinke that in thoſe 33. dayes, He in His manly being, did view this earth and the fulneſſe thereof, and eſpecially viſit and bleſſe thoſe places where He did purpoſe that His Church and trueth ſhould moſt of all flouriſh and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. Thus much for the queſtions by the way. Now turne to that which is the maine. To every degree of the abaſement of our Redeemer, there is a degree of exaltation and glory oppoſed. So this of the Aſcenſion of our Lord into Heaven, is ſet againſt
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:107656:153"/>that of His deſcent into hell, and that by the authority of Saint <hi>Paul, He that deſcended, is even the ſame that aſcended.</hi> And although it may very well be thought, that after His Paſſion finiſhed on the Croſſe by His death, His going to hell was the beginning of His victory, to take to Himſelfe that power whereby He, as the Sonne of man, is to reigne over all the powers of death and hell; Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe His body during thoſe three dayes, is by moſt ſuppoſed to have been held under the power of death; and that all the parts of His victory are to belong unto Him, as Hee is Lord both of the quicke and dead, that is, in His intire humanity, ſoule and body to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; therefore that deſcent is rather held by many, as the loweſt eſtate of His humiliation, as you might read a little before. <hi>Chap.</hi> 28. § 2. <hi>N.</hi> 3. But that our Lord (after that He had by many and infallible ſignes and arguments, by the ſpace of fourty dayes, given abundant proofe of His reſurrection) did aſcend into heaven, theſe reaſons doe make it manifeſt.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Vnto every body is a place due, according to the qualities and properties of that body, as in all natures here below, it appeares that the place is both conſeruative, and alſo generative of thoſe things which are peculiar thereto, as the lower parts of the earth of the mineralls; the ſurface of the vegetables; the water of fiſhes, &amp;c. And againe it is manifeſt that all things under the Moone are ſubject to corruption and change: no beauty, ſtrength, or excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is ſuch as is not fading: no pleaſure ſuch, but that in the very uſing it growes loath ſome: no bravery ſo coſtly, but in three dayes wearing it waxes ſtale; ſo that by the voice and conſent of all men, the Angels and bleſſed ſoules, and all ſuch beings as are free from corruption, and in the ſtate of glory, are ſent into heaven. But it is manifeſt that our Lord by His reſurrection and conqueſt of death, purchaſed firſt to Himſelfe, and then to us, a ſtate of glory and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality. <hi>Romanes</hi> 6.9. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.6. Therefore alſo that <hi>Hee aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended into heaven.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. The bleſſedneſſe of the creature is onely in this, That it may behold the glory of God, in whom alone is the excellency of all perfection; And this glory is ſeene onely in the face of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> the Mediator, as was ſhewed <hi>Chapter</hi> 24. § 10. <hi>N.</hi> 5. unto which bleſſedneſſe, onely the pure and bleſſed inhabitants of heaven, as the holy Angels and ſoules of men, are dignified. And from hence it muſt follow, that our Lord is aſcended into heaven, the place of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and happy ſoules: For no man dwelling in his ruinous houſe of clay, is able to behold that glory. <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.20.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Hell is the place of torments; the earth of troubles, changes and calamities; therefore heaven is the place of happineſſe, or elſe no happineſſe at all is to be found. But that is impoſſible. For ſo all things ſhould be created to wretchedneſſe and miſery onely, which cannot ſtand with the loue of God to His creature, and His infinite goodneſſe. And if any ſuch place of happineſſe be, and He
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:107656:153"/>our Saviour not brought thereto, then the greateſt obedience per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the Father for the manifeſtation of His glory, ſhould be without reward. But this were unjuſt with God, and therefore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. And therefore it was neceſſary that our Lord after His reſurrection, ſhould aſcend into heaven.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. By the conſent of Chriſtians taught of God, and of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens taught by nature, heaven is the place of the greateſt glory and happines, as hell of ſorrow and wretchednes. For although the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then allotted a degree of eternall bliſſe to the ſoules which they ſent to <hi>Elyſium,</hi> as you may read of <hi>Anchiſes</hi> and others, <hi>Aeneid.</hi> 6. yet they ſuppoſed that their falſe gods, and ſuch as were by them cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized, went up to heaven, as <hi>Hercules, Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux, Romulus,</hi> and he that was one of the chiefe maſters of the devills ſlaughter-men, <hi>Iulius Caeſar.</hi> From whence you may reaſon thus: The place of the greateſt glory is moſt due to Him that is both the Creator, and Reſtorer of all things. But ſuch was our Lord <hi>Ieſus,</hi> as it hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared before. Therefore <hi>He aſcended into heaven.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. It is neceſſary that the bleſſed and damned doe differ, by all thoſe meanes whereby the paines of the one, and the bleſſedneſſe of the other may be increaſed. The paines of the damned are increaſed by the horrour of that place wherein they are tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; therefore the joyes alſo of the bleſſed, are increaſed by the ſuperexcellent beauty and pleaſures of that place of their abode. And becauſe our Lord is bleſſed and holy above all that are bleſſed and holy, therefore it is neceſſary that He ſhould aſcend into heaven.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. If <hi>Chriſt</hi> after His reſurrection had not aſcended into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, then could no other creature bee bleſſed in heaven by His merit: So the place of perfect bliſſe ſhould be without inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and therefore created in vaine. So God ſhould want that praiſe which were due to Him for His mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſhewed to the creature. But theſe things are impoſſible. Therefore the holy Angels and Saints are bleſſed in heaven, and <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord, their King, among them. <hi>See Iohn</hi> 14.2, 3. <hi>and Epheſ.</hi> 2.6.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. If <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord had not aſcended into heaven; yea, ſo that His aſcenſion might be witneſſed both by men and Angels, <hi>Actes</hi> 1.10, 11. then could not we which beleeve in Him, have full aſſurance of thoſe heavenly joyes that are laid up in ſtore for us. 1. So the Chriſtian faith were all in vaine, and we ſtill ſubject to the puniſhment of our ſinnes. 2. So His Conception, Birth, Miracles, Sufferings, Death and Reſurrection, heretofore prooved, ſhould have beene in vaine; So His owne preaching, and of His meſſengers. 4. So the prophecies of the Scriptures which were before concerning Him, even ſince the world began, ſhould bee without their trueth. 5. So the faith and hope of them which confeſſe the moſt glorious things of God concerning His good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:107656:154"/>and mercy toward His creature; which faith they have in Him, being taught by Him out of his word, and by the ſucceſſe of all things that have come to paſſe accordingly ſhould be fruſtrate. But all theſe things are impoſſible. And therefore God is gone up on high in triumph, and our Lord with the ſound of the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, all the holy Angels, and the ſpirits and ſoules of the faithfull joying therein, all the troopes of the heavens, and the heavens of heavens attending His comming, and ſubmitting themſelues to Him their Lord and King. <hi>Open your heads, ô yee gates, and be yee ſet ope yee everlaſting doores, that the King of glory may come in. Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hoſtes mighty in battell,</hi> euen our Lord <hi>IESVS,</hi> who by the warres of His ſuffering and death on the Croſſe, and by the conqueſt of His reſurrection, hath overcome the powers of Hell, He is the King of Glory. <hi>Amen.</hi>

And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he brought nothing for the proofe of his opinions, but onely opinion, let them all vaniſh at the authority of the holy Scripture, as miſt before the Sunne. <hi>Carpocrates,</hi> as he had beene taught by <hi>Saturnilus,</hi> ſaid, that the ſoule was onely ſaved. <hi>Epiph: haereſ:</hi> 23.

The <hi>Seleucians</hi> confeſſe that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when He aſcended, tooke with Him His manly body, and carryed it as high as the Sunne, but there He put it off, and left it there. But Saint <hi>Paul</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes that He aſcended farre aboue all heavens, that is, all the viſible heavens, either of planets or ſtarres: yet they brought their reaſon out of the 19. <hi>Pſalm. verſ.</hi> 4. <hi>He hath ſet His tabernacle in the Sun.</hi> So the vulgar tranſlation of the Latines hath it from the Greeke, and ſo all the Greeke copies reade it, except that of <hi>Aquila,</hi> who according to the Hebrew hath it thus; <hi>In them</hi> [the heavens] <hi>He ſet a tabernacle for the Sunne,</hi> and this helpes the <hi>Seleucians</hi> nothing. But the errour which hath ſwayed moſt againſt this Article, and which with their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge, if they could ſee it, hath now defaced their Church, is that of the <hi>Vbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitaries,</hi> who becauſe they beleeve that very ſubſtance of the body and blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is received with the Bread and Wine; they are compell'd to ſay, That His naturall body may be in many, and conſequently, in all places at once; as His God-head is. And therefore, that this aſcenſin of <hi>Chriſt</hi> muſt be nothing elſe but a diſappearance out of the earth, or a vaniſhing from the ſight of men. For the ground of their opinion, they urge the word of our Lord, <hi>This is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, This is my blood,</hi> but they deny not the Bread and Wine to continue ſtill:
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:107656:154"/>which if it be true, then the ſence of the words muſt bee, <hi>In this, or with this Bread and Wine, is my body and blood.</hi> But the words beare no ſuch meaning, but prove much rather, that tranſubſtantiation or change of the Bread and Wine into the body and blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which the Papiſts would. But this opinion of the Papiſts, were to denie <hi>Chriſt</hi> to have taken fleſh of the Virgin-<hi>Mary,</hi> and ſo to have beene made of the ſeed of <hi>David,</hi> at leaſt in part of His bodily being, when His body and blood ſhould be made of bread and wine.

                           <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He great antiquitie of this Creed, appearing to be even from the time of the Apoſtles, brought ſome writers into an opinion that the twelue A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, before their departure from <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> to preach unto the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> gave out this forme of confeſſion of the faith, to bee acknowledged of every <hi>Convert,</hi> before they might bee bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and appointed that all interpretation of Scripture ſhould be made, according to the rule of it, as they will underſtand that text in <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.16. And ſome will yet bee more particular herein, that every Apoſtle brought in that Article which he thought fit to be beleeved: Yea, and for a need they will tell you which Article every Apoſtle made, and ſo have of neceſſitie li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Articles to the number of twelve. But the Scripture admits no other rule of Interpretation than it ſelfe. And ſo I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that the Creed, may be a rule, in as much as it hath the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in the Holy Scripture. As Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Symb. ad Catech. Chapter</hi> 1. <hi>Deus in eccleſia regulam, &amp;c.</hi> God would have one perpetuall rule to be in the Church, which ſhould be ſimple, briefe, and ſuch as every one might eaſily underſtand, according to which the godly mighty examine all doctrine, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the Scripture: to receive that which is agreeable thereunto, and to refuſe that which is contrary. And although for your ſatisfaction therein, I have followed the faſhion for the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Articles, as you may ſee; yet it cannot be denied, but that if you take every ſeveral concluſion for an Article, there are in all 17. or 18, at leaſt fifteene ſeverall Articles; of which, this of our <hi>Lords</hi> ſitting at the right hand of God, will be one, although in that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 12. it goe as a part of the Article before, <hi>Hee aſcended into heaven.</hi> But this is not a thing of any great importance; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us rather looke to the certainty thereof, for that is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for us to know and beleeve.</p>
                        <p>But it may be demanded, why in the Creed, ſuch a Metaphor ſhould be uſed, as might endanger younglings and novices to thinke with the <hi>Anthropomorphites,</hi> that the inviſible God is like to man, with hands and bodily parts. To which wee may anſwere, that the <hi>Christians</hi> (I ſpeake not of wilfull hereticks) were not ſo
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:107656:155"/>ill inſtructed, but that they knew right well how to diſcerne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Chriſt</hi> and a Vine, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. betweene a figurative and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſpeech. And therefore the Fathers in the Church, the Author, or Authors of this Creed, having a jealous care of the trueth of God, doubted not to propoſe it in the words of God Himſelfe. Therefore ſeeing this part of <hi>Christs</hi> glory is ſo propheſied to bee fulfilled, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. cited, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.13. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my Lord, ſit at my right hand, untill I make thine enemies thy foot-ſtoole,</hi> it is ſo to be retained in the Article of our Creed. And although it bee a borrowed ſpeech, yet ſeeing it is ſo taken into uſe by our Lord Himſelfe, and by the Pen-men of the New-Teſtament, it is by all meanes moſt fit ſo to hold it. For ſo our Lord ſpeakes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.64. and <hi>Luke</hi> 22.69. <hi>Hereafter ſhall you ſee the Sonne of man ſit on the right hand of the Power of God.</hi> So <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Christ ſitteth above at the right hand of God.</hi> So <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.3. and 10.12. and 12.2. with many other Scriptures to the like purpoſe. The word <hi>To ſit,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies either to tarry or continue, as in <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.49. <gap reason="foreign">

Hee being by the right hand (that is, the power) of God, exalted: or elſe it ſignifies happineſſe, and joy eternall, as it is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. and 11. <hi>verſe: At thy right hand are pleaſures for evermore.</hi> And although ſome Interpreters make the meaning of this Article, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> as God, hath equall glory and power with the Father; yet all theſe Articles, from the ſecond to the eight, ſhew what wee are to beleeve of our Mediatour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning His man-hood. And as our Saviour, in the ſtate of His humiliation, was for the greater ſcorne and contempt, crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed betweene the two malefactors, one on the right hand, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the left; So in this glory of His, oppoſed thereto, He is ſet on the right hand of the Majeſtie on high, the principalities and powers being ſubjected unto Him. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.22. So then the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Article is, not onely that <hi>Christ</hi> in our nature <hi>(confide caro)</hi> ſits at the right hand of God in heaven, but alſo as Hee ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18. that <hi>All power is given unto Him, both in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and in earth.</hi> Vnto Him (I ſay) is all power given to raigne, and to order the ſtate of the world, not onely as the ſonne of God, which He did, and doth eternally with the Father, and the <hi>Holy-Ghost, Pro.</hi> 18.15. but as He is the Son of man, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.27. as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.28. <hi>He (that was raiſed from the dead) must reigne till Hee hath put all His enemies under His feete.</hi> This glory of <hi>Christ</hi> is thus declared, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1.20. &amp;c. <hi>God having raiſed Him from the dead, hath ſet Him at His right hand, in the heavenly places, farre above all principalitie and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not onely in this world, but alſo in that which is to come, and hath put all things under his feete, and hath given Him
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:107656:156"/>to bee the head over all things unto his Church.</hi> The manifeſtation therefore of this glory in the humanitie and the exerciſe of this power is in the diſcharge and execution of thoſe offices and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which He hath received of the Father, to bee the King, the Prieſt and Prophet unto His Church. He then as King, doth or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the affaires of the world, ſometime reſtraining the power of Tyrants and Perſecutors of His trueth; ſometimes ſuffering their rage to grow on high; yet arming the hearts of His ſeruants and ſubjects with courage and conſtancy againſt their fury, that it may appeare, that He raignes in the hearts of men, and turneth them whitherſoever He will: Otherwhile againe, giving Kings and Queenes to bee nurſing Fathers and nurſing Mothers unto His Church, that trueth may flouriſh in the earth, as Righteouſneſſe hath looked downe from Heaven. And concerning His Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, this is the ſumme, that wee have ſuch an High-Prieſt, <hi>Who is ſet at the right hand of the throne of the Majeſtie of heaven, to appeare in the ſight of God for us, to offer up our Prayers, to pleade our cauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the infinite Iuſtice, and thereunto to preſent what Himſelfe hath done, and ſuffered in our behalfe, Heb.</hi> 8.1. and 9.24. and of theſe two, that is His Kingdome, and His Prieſt-hood, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, <hi>Actes</hi> 2.36. <hi>Let all the houſe of Iſrael know aſſuredly, that God hath made this Ieſus, both Lord and Christ.</hi> The office of His pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie is in this, that as before His appearance in the fleſh, Hee by His Holy Spirit inſtructed the Prophets: ſo after that, when Hee aſcended on high, He gave gifts unto men; ſome to bee Apoſtles, ſome Evangeliſts, ſome Paſtors and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the worke of the miniſtery, for the edifying of the body of <hi>Christ, Ephe.</hi> 4.11.12. And hereunto belong all thoſe meanes which he hath made ſubſervient hereunto, by His Holy Spirit, ſtirring up the hearts of Kings and Princes, and other noble benefactors for the eſtabliſhment and maintenance of Vniverſities or Schooles of the Prophets. But as the great rivers are nothing elſe but the gathering together of waters from many ſmaller foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and gilz: ſo the particular Schooles; founded by charitable and well-minded men, ſuch as the moſt vertuous <hi>Iohn Colet</hi> Deane of <hi>Paules,</hi> and founder of that Schoole was; are the perpetuall ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, without which the Vniverſities could not be furniſhed either with Prophets, or with Prophets ſonnes. And therefore for theſe alſo doth our Lord, now ſitting at the right hand of the Father, by His Holy Spirit furniſh men with the gift of tongues, and their interpretation. And therefore you my <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, knowing that an account muſt be made for whatſoever wee have received, either of gifts, or maintenance hereunto. And although beſides our endleſſe paines, wee endure the inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of theſe ill and diſſolute times, the idleneſſe and dulneſſe of many untoward and grace-leſſe children, the folly of ſome more wicked and unthankfull parents; though our imployment bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteemed:
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:107656:156"/>yet ſeeing the hope of the time to come is in our paines, let us for that duety which wee owe to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that love which wee beare to His Church and our Countrey, endeavour the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full diſcharge of our truſt, and remember that our reward is laid up in heaven. Now ſee the reaſons of the concluſion.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It is juſtice, that the loweſt degree of humility and abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for obedience ſake unto the will of God, ſhould bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with the greateſt glory and honour that may be done unto the creature. But it hath appeared heretofore, that our Lord <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for His obedience ſake to the will of His Father, became ſubject to poverty, that we might be rich. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9. <hi>Hee endured ſtripes, that we might bee healed.</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. That He ſuffered ſhame and death it ſelfe, for our offence, <hi>See hereto Chap.</hi> 27. Therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſet at the right hand of the Majeſty in heaven. This is the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12. <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Chriſt for the joy that was ſet before Him, endured the Croſſe, deſpiſed the ſhame, and ſate downe at the right hand of the throne of God.</hi> This is that argument whereby our Lord ſtrengthened Himſelfe againſt death. <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.32. <hi>If God be glorified in the Sonne of man, God ſhall alſo glorifie Him in Himſelfe.</hi>

                        <p n="2">2. To the moſt noble and worthy perſon, the moſt noble digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and excellencies doe belong. But the perſon of our Mediator, according to His God-head, hath equall glory and honour with the Father, and the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt.</hi> Therefore to Him it belongs alſo, as man, to ſit at the right hand of the Father, <hi>(a)</hi> becauſe of His uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the God-head. For although in His God-head He could not ſuffer nor die: yet becauſe His God-head was clouded in His humanity, the whole Perſon was truely ſaid to bee both hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and exalted. And as by that humiliation and offering of His body and blood, Hee made a full ſatisfaction to the infinite juſtice, for the ſinne of His people: So did Hee merit and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, both to Himſelfe and to His choſen, all that honour and happineſſe which either the one or the other can bee capeable of. And therefore in His humanity to ſit at the right hand of God.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. It is neceſſary that He ſit at the right hand of power, that is, have the ſuperexcellency of all power in Himſelfe: by whom the perfection and happineſſe of the creature is to be wrought, and by whom the greateſt aduerſary to God, and to the happineſſe of the creature, muſt be ſubdued. But it is manifeſt that our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is to be perfected onely by <hi>Christ</hi> our Saviour: and that the workes of the devill our aduerſary, are to be deſtroyed onely by Him. 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.8. Therefore it is neceſſary that He ſit at the right hand of the power in heaven.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. It is beſeeming and neceſſary that Hee ſhould have <hi>(b)</hi> ſome preeminence above mankind, by whom all joy and bleſſedneſſe was procured unto mankind; in as much as that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:107656:157"/>bleſſedneſſe belongs properly unto Him that purcha'ſte it: but to him for whom it was purcha'ſte, it belongs onely by grace and participation. But the reſurrection of the body, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion into heaven, belong to us, as it were in common with <hi>Christ,</hi> in as much as the faithfull muſt riſe againe, and after judgement aſcend with Him into Heaven. <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.24. and 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.17. Therefore to ſit at the right hand of the power of God, is peculiar unto <hi>Christ</hi> alone. And although it be ſaid, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.6. that we are made to ſit together in heavenly places in <hi>Christ;</hi> yet that is ſpoken onely of that abundant happineſſe and joy which we ſhall finde in eternall life, as the text was cited euen now, out of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.11.</p>

                              <hi>(a) BEcauſe of His vnion with the God-head.</hi> The Apoſtle, in the firſt <hi>Chap.</hi> of the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> proves by many arguments that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator muſt be God: in the ſecond <hi>Chapter,</hi> that Hee muſt bee man. Among thoſe reaſons, whereby He proves that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is God, this is one: becauſe it was ſaid vnto Him, <hi>Sit at my right hand.</hi> For God that gives not His glory unto another, <hi>Eſay</hi> 42.8. doth not give this glory to ſit at His right hand, unto any one that is a creature onely. Therefore doth not our Lord ſit at the right hand of God, but as man ſubſiſting in the Perſon of the Sonne of God: neither yet as God, being one with the Father in the infinitie of being and power, is Hee ſaid to bee ſo exalted, as to <hi>Sit at the right hand of God,</hi> but onely as He is God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in the fleſh. For this exaltation and glory was given unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as the reward of His humiliation, as it is ſaid, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8.9. <hi>Hee humbled Himſelfe, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſſe: Wherefore God alſo hath highly exalted Him, and given Him a Name which is above every name, &amp;c.</hi> So that the glory of ſitting at the right hand of God, is due unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> as the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,</hi> that is both God and man in one Perſon.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>(b) Some preheminence above man-kind:</hi> Although the graces and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and conſequently the glory of <hi>Chriſts</hi> humanity in the Perſon of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head be ſo ſuper-excellent, as all the Angels in heaven cannot comprehend: yet doth not that glory and perfection take away the proprieties of the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; nor yet <hi>His ſitting at the right hand of God,</hi> take away His ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto God. For Hee is excepted that did put all things under Him: and when all things are ſubdued unto Him, then the Sonne alſo Himſelfe ſhalbe ſubject, that God may be All in All, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.27.28. becauſe that then the government and mediation of the Sonne is perfected in the creature, when it doth appeare, that God hath loved the Church, euen as He hath loved Him. <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.23. If then <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord be ſtill God and man; or elſe He ceaſes to be our Mediator: and if to take away the properties of His humanity, as to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in a certaine place, be to deny Him to be man, as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith; Take away place and you deny all bodily being. How can that falſhood of the every-where being, of <hi>Chriſts</hi> body, be iuſtified? I ſaid enough againſt this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, in the <hi>Note</hi> on the Chapter before: but they argue alſo from this Article thus; The right hand of God is every where. <hi>Chriſt</hi> in His bodily being, ſits at the right hand of God; <hi>Ergo,</hi> His body is every where. If this be a good
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:107656:157"/>concluſion, then why not this? The right hand of God is eternall. <hi>Chriſt</hi> in His bodily being, ſits at the right hand of God: <hi>Ergo,</hi> His body is eternall. But this againſt the Article, <hi>He was borne of a Virgin.</hi> Beſide, the Aſſumption ſhould be, the body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the right hand of God; but that is moſt falſe: and this is moſt faulty of all, to take a tropicall ſpeech, as if it did ſignifie properly. <hi>See Log: chap.</hi> 21. <hi>N.</hi> 5. The errours mentioned, with this, in the Note on the Chapter before, need not to be remembred.</p>
                           <p>Another errour againſt this Article of <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſitting at the right hand of God, and making interceſsion for the Saints, is of them who pray to Saints and Angels, and ſo deny the Al-ſufficiency of His mediation, and make void that text of the Scripture. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. <hi>There is one Mediator betweene God and man, the man Chriſt IESVS.</hi> But they have a pretty diſtinction for it, if it were ought worth, that the Saints are not Mediators of ſatisfaction; for ſo is <hi>Chriſt</hi> alone; but of Interceſsion only: If we ſhould be content with this, yet all their workes of Supererogation are vaniſhed, and all their ſaleable treaſure of their Church not worth a mite. For the merit of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not ſaleable, but for every one that will, to buy without money. <hi>Eſay</hi> 55.1. And that becauſe it is infinite and unvaluable, as the ranſome of ſinne muſt be, and no mans merit can be. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, the Scripture ſaith, <hi>That Abraham knowes us not, and Iſrael is ignorant of us. Eſay</hi> 63.16. And therefore, as a Father ſaith, It is the moſt ſafe aduenture, for a man to commit himſelfe onely to the hands of God.</p>
                           <p>A third errour is of them who ſacrilegiouſly withhold thoſe tithes which God hath allotted for the Miniſters of the Church, as you may ſee it prooved by them who have writ to this argument, whatſoever any lying Legend hath brought to the contrary: you may reade Sir <hi>Henry Spelman, Iames Sempal,</hi> and eſpecially the Reverend Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter</hi> to this argument. And ſo no leſſe are they in this hereſie, who withhold, or curtaile, or inuert by any meanes, thoſe maintenances which the founders of Schooles or Colledges have appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as Seed-plots, for the Church. And theſe ſacrilegious errours are the more damnable; as an errour in fact, is worſe then an errour in opinion. And if you looke unto the ſtate of thoſe Churches, where that competency of which they prate was firſt eſtabliſhed, in <hi>France,</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and elſe-where: you may ſee not onely the contempt and beggery wherein the Miniſters live; but that even the whole Churches, have ever ſince the time of this competency, lived under perſecution. And if whole Churches and Common-wealths ſuffer for this, ſhall you ſacrilegious Impropriators, you ſaleable Latrones, and you falſe feoffees, that are unfaithfull in other mens wealth, unfaithfull in that which is committed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you onely in truſt, eſcape, though you be long forborne? He that ſhall come, will come, and will not ſtay, to give to every man as his workes ſhall be, not as they are here in ſhew, or with pretext, that I am but one. And this is the next Article whereto ye ſhall be ſummoned. <hi>Ariſe ye dead, and come to judgement.</hi>

                        <p>§ 1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He word, <hi>to Iudge,</hi> hath many ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in the Holy Scripture. But in this Article of our Creed, it is taken onely for the execution of that eternal doome upon men and Angels, when God by <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall raiſe up all that are dead, and by the miniſtery of the Angels ſhall bring all both good and bad be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Him, that every man may receive the things done in his body, according to that which he hath done, whether it bee good or ill, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. So the reſurrection of the body, is in order of time before this Iudgement: yet is it here ſet before it; becauſe it is a part of that glory which is given unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for that abaſement and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy of ſinners, which He endured when He was moſt ſhamefully and deſpitefully intreated before the Prieſts (when they ſmote the Iudge of <hi>Iſrael</hi> with a rod upon the cheeke, <hi>Mic.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.64. and after, moſt unjuſtly condemned him before <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi>) And becauſe it is fit that they which are to bee judged ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold their judge: therefore the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgement unto the Sonne, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.22. as it is ſaid,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:107656:159"/>
                           <hi>Actes</hi> 17.31. That God hath appointed a day, in which Hee will judge the world in righteouſneſſe, by the man whom Hee hath ordained; whereof He hath given aſſurance unto all men, in that He hath raiſed Him from the dead. So the authority or power is of the Father: the adminiſtration or performance of the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is by the Sonne, and that, as He is the Sonne of man in the Perſon of the Deitie. For as by the perpetuall influence of the Deitie upon the ſoule of <hi>Christ,</hi> Hee is able to know the ſecrets of all hearts: ſo being man, touched with the feeling of our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as having beene tempted in all points, like as wee are, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſinne, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4.15. He ſhall adminiſter juſtice, and pronounce His ſentence with that equitie, that even the damned ſhall confeſſe that their condemnation is moſt juſt. But the judgement is either particular or generall. For, inaſmuch as the ſoule being ſeparate from the body, is capable of joy or paine, therefore immediately after the departure, doth it goe, either to happineſſe, or ſorrow, as it is plaine by the hiſtory of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and the rich man, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. and as our Lord ſaid unto the thiefe, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.43. <hi>This day ſhalt thou bee with mee in Paradiſe.</hi> So Saint <hi>Paul</hi> deſired to depart and to bee with <hi>Christ. Phil.</hi> 1.23. To this purpoſe you may reade more, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. from <hi>verſe</hi> 1. to 9. For becauſe the deedes to which puniſhment is due, are voluntary: For otherwiſe they were not ſinfully ſinfull: and that the will is in the ſoule, not in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: therefore the puniſhment comes firſt upon the ſoule, as it is ſaid, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 4.18. <hi>The ſoule that ſinneth ſhall die:</hi> and by the ſoule upon the body, at the reſurrection. In the meane while (as it hath beene ſaid) the ſoule hath a feeling of the wrath of God, being ſhut out from His preſence, and a fearefull expectation of thoſe torments which it ſhall endure, when it ſhall be joyned to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy againe. So alſo the ſoules of the Saints immediately after they are delivered from the burden of the fleſh, are in joy and felicity, having the feeling of the favour of God, and the full and aſſured knowledge of the forgiveneſſe of their ſinnes, and waiting for the time of that bleſſed Reſurrection, when they ſhall enjoy their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies againe, and in the meane time, this is their Paradiſe, this is their heaven.</p>
                        <p>And thus the ſentence being beforehard paſſed on every man particularly: that generall Iudgement is onely the publication and execution of that ſentence, when the bleſſed ſhall both in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſoule receive the full accompliſhment of all their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and the damned likewiſe, the full meaſure of their torment in hell: And therefore is that day, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5. called the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous Iudgement of God. And if for the authorities and reaſons brought, it bee evident, that the ſoule immediately after it is departed, is a partaker of joy or paine: How ſhall we hearken to that doctrine of the <hi>Sadduces, Act.</hi> 23.8. or to that <hi>Arabian</hi> errour of the <hi>Thnetopſychitae,</hi> that the ſoule doth
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:107656:159"/>die with the body? Or to our late dreamers the <hi>Pſychopannychitae,</hi> who affirme, that the ſoule ſleepes in the grave till it bee awaked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with the body at the generall reſurrection?</p>
                        <p>§. 2. <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> Now concerning the circumſtances of the generall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is manifeſt by the word of the Holy Scripture, firſt that, that the time thereof is unknowne. <hi>For Hee ſhall come as a thiefe in the night,</hi> 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.2. and 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10. or as in the dayes of <hi>Noah, Matth.</hi> 24.37. to 47. For as the houre of death, or the time of the particular Iudgment is uncertaine to every man, and that for our exceeding benefit; that wee ſhould not through careleſneſſe run into ſinne, but that wee ſhould ever be mindfull to watch: So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is that day of the univerſall judgement. For ſeeing all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind muſt ſtand in this generall judgement, therefore it cannot be, but at the end of the world, as it is manifeſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.40. &amp;c. to 49. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20.21. And therefore in His power onely that made the world. And as no wiſedome beſide His owne was in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the world; ſo ſhall there be no other wiſedome either in the continuance, or putting an end thereto, beſide His owne. And ſeeing wee know nothing of the Fathers will, but by the Sonne; if the Sonne Himſelfe knew not the time, <hi>Mark.</hi> 13.32. who may preſume to know it without Him? But you will ſay, how could the Sonne bee ignorant of that day; ſeeing by the influence of the Deitie on His humane ſoule, Hee might know what Hee would know? <hi>I Anſwere.</hi> His comming was to give life unto the world, and withall, the knowledge of all thoſe things, and them onely which were profitable for His Church to know: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the knowledge of the time of this judgement for the avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of ſecurity, was no way either neceſſary or convenient to bee knowne, therefore our Mediator would not know that which was not fit to bee revealed to His Church. For He would be like to us in all things, except our ſinne. And I have heretofore ſhewed, that ſome kindes of jgnorance are not ſinfull. And therefore that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſh fancie that will limit the day of Iudgement, to the moneth of <hi>February,</hi> which ſhall be in the yeere of our Lord, 1645. is very weake, and contrary to thoſe propheſies of Scripture, which teach us to expect the conuerſion of the <hi>Iewes;</hi> And with them, the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and that Sabbatiſme or reſtitution of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is ſo often promiſed both in the old and in the new <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,</hi> as it may hereafter appeare more at large. Yet as by the Spring wee know the approach of Summer; ſo hath He given us certaine ſignes, that wee may lift up our heads, and know that our redemption is nigh at hand. For as it is a manifeſt ſigne, that the deſtruction of that Nation is nigh, when every man is oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed one by another, when the Boy ſhall behave Himſelfe proudly againſt the Ancient, the baſe againſt the honourable, <hi>Eſay</hi> 3.5. yea, and bee upheld therein; <hi>O times!</hi> Into what corruption of manners are wee fallen? So when all charity is put only in the

And as the holy Angels ſhall then rejoyce with joy unſpeakable, for that glory and mercy which God ſhall vouchſafe unto His Saints; So the Saints like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſhall give glory and thankes to God, for that encreaſe of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and happineſſe which He ſhall give unto the holy angels, as the reward of their continuall watch and guard which they have held about us, all the time of our pilgrimage upon earth, and at the houre of death, helping the ſoule out of the priſon of the body, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting it unto the place of joy.</p>
                        <p>But it is ſaid, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.11. <hi>That the Prince of this world is judged already;</hi> how they ſhall we judge the Angels? <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill is judged already. 1. In the decree of God. 2. By the word of God, he is declared to be reſerued in chaines of darkneſſe, and that hell fire is prepared for him and his angels. 3. By his owne knowledge of his owne eſtate. 4. Becauſe his torment is in part begun. But in judgement there be two things; Firſt the enquiry of the fact, then the award of the reward. Neither the deeds of the good or bad angels ſhall bee enquired into at the judgement (<hi>(a)</hi> as ſome have thought) but the reward ſhall bee aſſigned unto them both, and acknowledged to be moſt juſt by the Church (as I ſaid before) and this is our judgement of them. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet ſhall the ſenceleſſe creatures be exempted from this judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in as much as <hi>The elements ſhall melt with heate, and the earth with the workes thereof ſhall burne.</hi> 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10. that they may be freed from that corruption to which they are ſubject for the ſinne of man. For when man ſinned, the whole bodily creature which was made for man, was thereby ſubjected to vanity, not of it owne will, or any inclination which was therein, in reſpect of any weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſtate wherein it was created, <hi>For all was exceeding good. Gen.</hi> 1.31. but that the juſtice of God againſt ſinne might be manifeſt, is it ſubjected to the curſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.18, 19. yet under hope that when man is freed from his ſinne, the creature alſo ſhall be reſtored unto that libertie from corruption, wherein it was created, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.20. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as it is ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.1. and 5. <hi>Behold I create all things new, See</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.13.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Another doubt may bee concerning the forme of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, whereby it may ſeeme that the merit of workes is juſtified:
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:107656:161"/>For ſo is the ſentence pronounced, <hi>Come yee bleſſed, receive the King-dome prepared for you; for I was hungry, and ye gave Mee meat, &amp;c.</hi> and on the other ſide, <hi>Depart ye curſed, for I was hungry, and ye gave Me no meat, &amp;c. Mat.</hi> 25.35. to 46. <hi>Anſ.</hi> It cannot bedenied, but that the ſentence of condemnation upon the reprobate, is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their workes, as the deſeruing cauſes thereof; For not tobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is that great ſin which is the cauſe of condemnation. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.18. and 16.9. Neither is a dead faith ought worth, but that faith onely is accepted which worketh by love. <hi>Galat.</hi> 5.6. <hi>without which, it is impoſsible to pleaſe God. Hebr.</hi> 11.6. And if all things that are not of faith, be ſinne. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.23. Then the wicked works of Infidels and Hypocrites, and much more their violent and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full rebellions, muſt needs be concurrent cauſes of their condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But the faithfull are therefore called to poſſeſſe the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. 1. Becauſe they are bleſſed of the Father. 2. Becauſe they are predeſtinate thereto, and the kingdome prepared for them, from the beginning of the world. So their workes come not as cauſes of their happineſſe, but onely as the fruits of their faith. But becauſe workes onely, and not faith in the heart, are manifeſt to the world; therefore is the compariſon made onely of the workes, both of the godly and of the wicked, that the juſtice of God may be manifeſted in rewarding the workes that are manifeſt to man.</p>

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:107656:161"/>And therefore Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2.18. <hi>This is the laſt time.</hi> And although Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſay, 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 4.7. <hi>That the end of all things is at hand,</hi> and that therefore we ſhould be ſober and watch unto prayer; becauſe we know not when our Lord ſhall call us to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular account of our ſtewardſhip, when all things of this world are ended with us: Yet Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. directly affirmeth, in his time, that that great day of God ſhould not come, till the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie was revealed, which could not be till he that withheld, that is, the Imperiall power that then ruled, was taken out of the way.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. But ſeeing that day of God is ſo terrible to the wicked, as that they put it farre from them, and agame ſo much deſired of the godly, as that they cry, <hi>Come Lord Ieſus, Come;</hi> it may ſeeme not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unfit to ſee ſome reaſons of their different deſires. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the wicked, it is manifeſt, that they being condemned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in their owne conſciences, have great cauſe to wiſh that there were no day of judgement, no judge, no tormentors. But the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in <hi>Christ,</hi> who have the teſtimony of God in their hearts, that their ſinnes are covered, have great reaſon to deſire that day. Firſt and above all, that the glory of God, His mercy and juſtice may be manifeſt. Secondly, that the merit of <hi>Christs</hi> ſufferings may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to the glory of His grace, in them, that they may have the actuall poſſeſſion of that happineſſe which they have here onely in the aſſurance of hope. And no leſſe doe they deſire that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, that the body of ſinne may be truely aboliſhed. For which deſires ſake, even death it ſelfe, is here in life oftentimes deſired, and when it comes, is moſt willingly embraced; becauſe that thereby they are juſtified from their ſin. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.7. And among other cauſes, for which they pray that the Kingdome of God may come, this is one, that although euen becauſe they refraine from ill, therefore doe they make themſelues as a prey. <hi>Eſay</hi> 59.15. yet in that day the trueth of their innocency ſhall be knowne. And although here the more innocent and harmeleſſe a man is, the more is hee ſubject to injuries, ſlanders and ſurmiſes, and that becauſe men have for ſaken the feare of the Almightie, and having forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that he that taketh up, not onely hee that raiſeth a ſlander (which every baſe varlet may doe) but hee that beleeveth it, and and much more he that furthereth it, hath no part in that King-dome, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.3. Yet they uſe their tongues as if they were their owne, and remember not that they muſt give an account of every idle, much more of every lying and hurtfull word. And heere there be ſome which doubt not to ſay, that the godly may deſire the comming of that day, that they may ſee the reward of the wicked, perhaps upon that text where it is ſaid, <hi>The Righteous ſhall be glad when he ſeeth the vengeance, Pſal.</hi> 58.10. But I ſuppoſe it neceſſary to anſwere with this difference; That ſo farre foorth as a wicked man, or men are declared the enemies of God, of <hi>Christ,</hi> of His Church, a Chriſtian may ſay: <hi>Doe not I hate them, ô Lord,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:107656:162"/>that hate thee? yea, I hate them with perfect hatred, as if they were mine enemies. Pſal.</hi> 139. <hi>ver.</hi> 21.22. (the hatred muſt be of their ſinnes, not of their perſons) but concerning thoſe offences that are towards a mans owne ſelfe; let the ſame mind be in us which was in <hi>Christ Ieſus,</hi> who ſuffered for us, leaving us an example, that we ſhould follow His ſteps, who being reviled, reviled not againe; who being mocked and wounded, yet made interceſſion for the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors. Therefore, though thine enemies deſpight thee dayly without a cauſe; though he that eates thy bread, lift up his heele a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee; though the drunkards make ſongs upon thee, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that there is a reward for the righteous, that thy innocency ſhall breake forth as the light, and thy patience ſhall ſhine as the noone day.

                        <p n="5">5. It may further be objected from <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3.17. <hi>That God ſent not His Son into the world, to condemne the world, but that the world by Him might be ſaved.</hi> And if He came to ſave the world, how ſhall He judge and condemne the wicked to Hell fire, ſeeing this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the end of His comming? <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Firſt, that is ſpoken of His firſt comming onely. Secondly, it is manifeſt by the verſe before, <hi>verſe</hi> 16. that the world in this place ſignifies onely the faithfull in the world, for whoſe ſake the world is, and continues. For to theſe only, God gave His only Son, that they ſhould not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, but have everlaſting life. And as <hi>Chriſt</hi> was once offered for theſe, at His firſt comming; ſo for theſe ſhall He appeare the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time to ſalvation. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.28. For the laſt judgment being but the confirmation of the ſentence of their juſtification, by the death of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the putting of them in the actuall poſſeſſion of thoſe promiſes that depend thereon; their ſinnes are ſo covered, as that <hi>(b)</hi> there ſhall not be any remembrance of them in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For the worſhippers that are once purged, have no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of ſinne to their condemnation. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.2. ſeeing the gifts and calling of God are without repentance. And therefore (as a countrey-man of ours ſaith well. <hi>Ames Med: Theol: Cap.</hi> 41) This judgement, in reſpect of the faithfull, is eſſentiall unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
                           <pb n="97" facs="tcp:107656:162"/>as He is the Mediator: but in reſpect of the unfaithfull, it is of power onely, given Him by the Father, not eſſentiall to His media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but ſome way belonging to the perfection thereof; becauſe the Father hath committed all judgement to the Sonne. Yet let me adde thus much, that although the judgement of condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be not eſſentiall to <hi>Christ,</hi> as the Mediator of reconciliation; yet He being the great Steward of the houſe of God, it is eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to Him as the Son of God, to take vengeance without mercy on them that diſhonour His Father, and deſpight the Holy Spirit of grace, which by the light of their conſciences proclaimes their ſin unto them, which they will in no wiſe forſake.</p>

Moreover though for your reaſons againſt the eternitie of the world, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. it may ſeeme the world is not eternall, <hi>à parte antè,</hi> but that it had a beginning; yet is it not cleare, but that it may be eternall, <hi>à parte pòst,</hi> and continue for ever, in as much as the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor cannot repent Himſelfe to bee the work-maſter of ſo glorious a frame: So not to continue it in that being which it hath, and to doe good unto it, as the Pſalmiſt confeſſeth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. <hi>verſe</hi> 31. <hi>The glory of the Lord ſhall endure for ever; the Lord ſhall rejoyce in His workes.</hi> And if all the creature being made, was exceeding good, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. the deſtroying of ſo great a good cannot bee but a very great ill, which is farre from that goodneſſe, by which it was created. <hi>I anſwere.</hi> That the Text of <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> prooves not but that the judgement ſhall ſit at laſt, and the bookes of every mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſhall be open, that the judgement may be acknowledged to be according to their workes. And although the time ſeems to us to bee prolonged, that the number of the elect may bee fulfilled, that the patience and long-ſuffering of God towards the wicked may be manifeſt, for their repentance, that the deſire of the godly, and their longing for His comming may be inflamed: Yet to Him the time is determined, and can neither be longer nor ſhorter than He hath appointed: onely that comming to judgement hath been proclaimed ſo long before, that in all ages, men remembring the judgement, might avoid thoſe things for which they ſhould bee condemned. So for thoſe reaſons wherby you would enforce the continuance of the world for ever, it hath beene anſwered, that it is for the greater good to man and the creature which was made for his uſe, that this world ſhould have an end, that the creature might be freed from that corruption to which it is ſubject by reaſon of his ſinne, then that it ſhould ſtill continue. Neither doth that text of the 104. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> prove any thing to the contrary. For as
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:107656:163"/>the glory of God had endured in eternity before the world: ſo ſhall it continue, when neither the heaven nor the earth, nor yet their places ſhall be found any more, <hi>Reu.</hi> 20.11. And as for that glory of His, which is manifeſt in the creature, it ſhall bee more wonderfull and excellent in that worke of His recreation, which the <hi>Cabaliſts</hi> call <hi>de Mercava,</hi> when the creature in the world to come ſhall be brought to glory, and be able to conſider the ſuper-excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of His mercy and goodneſſe, than it is in this worke, <hi>de Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſhith,</hi> or ſtate of creation in this preſent world. And if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation of this preſent being, ſeeme to be ill, becauſe the being of the creature was good in the ſtate of creation: then the taking away of all this ill, and miſery which is ſince come upon the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by reaſon of ſinne, and the reſtoring of it into an eſtate of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, without compariſon, better and ſurer than that wherein it was created, muſt in both reſpects be a far greater good, than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to have created it ſuch as it was, or to continue it in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent being. Bring hither what you finde in the 18. <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> §. 2.</p>
                        <p>But becauſe it ſeemes not fully proved unto you, that this race and ſtare of man-kind, and the world with him muſt come to an end, take with you a reaſon or two, and thinke on them.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It hath already beene ſhewed, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. that no kind of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, either of continuance, of power, of number, &amp;c. can belong unto the world, or to the creatures therein contained, from whence the preſent doubt is eaſily aſſoyled.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Alſo it hath beene proved before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. that man was created innocent: and our miſerable experience ſhewes, that wee are now ſubject to ſinne, and the puniſhment thereof, death. It hath likewiſe appeared, that there is a reſtoring of man-kind to a better life than that in which man was created, which cannot be but in the perfection of the whole man, both in body and ſoule, as it will appeare further in the 38. <hi>Chapter.</hi> But it is impoſſible that a finite matier, ſhould be ſufficient for infinite bodies: yet if the race and generation of man-kind ſhould have no end, then their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies muſt needs be infinite, which becauſe it is impoſſible, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the generation of mankind muſt have an end.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The generation of man-kind is either by chance and fortune, and ſo it cannot be continuall, either before, or after; or elſe it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, and ſo it muſt needs bee for ſome end: For every motion hath an end when it is come to that period or bound wherein it doth reſt; otherwiſe, nature ſhould worke in vaine, which cannot ſtand with that wiſedome which gave power unto nature, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed unto it how it ſhould worke, and propoſed to what end. But if the generation of man-kind be infinite, then it is impoſſible that ever it ſhould come unto that uttermoſt end for which it was ordained. For although theſe, and the millions of men that have beene, and are, ſhall arive unto that end for which they were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:107656:163"/>yet they that are to come in infinitie, cannot all be brought to that end which is finite and determined. Therefore the generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of man-kind muſt needs be finite.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. If there ſhall not be an end of the generation of men, then there can be no differences among them: as to bee vertuous, and vitious; wiſe, and fooles; good, and bad, &amp;c. But this is moſt falſe and contrary to experience: yet the former conſequence is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. For it being put (as the reaſons before partly ſhew, and partly ſuppoſe) that every man ſhall have his owne body, and his owne ſoule: yet if the matier whereof their bodies ſhall be made, bee fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, it will be impoſſible that infinite bodies be made thereof: If it be infinite, yet an infinite number of bodies will bee anſwerable thereto: So that if the number of Wiſe-men be infinite, there will be no matier for the bodies of fooles: if that number of fooles bee infinite, there will be no matier for the bodies of the wiſe; if both be infinite, yet one infinitie of matier cannot be ſufficient for two infinities of bodies: if both bee finite, then have wee that wee ſought for, and the generation of men muſt of neceſſity have an end.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Nothing that is infinite, can conſiſt of parts that are finite; for theſe being termes contradictory, and moſt oppoſed, cannot be the originall one of another. But every particular man in this ſuppoſed infinitie of the generation of men, is finite in his being, in his continuance, and in every other circumſtance of his being: So this infinitie in every of the parts thereof, muſt be finite, and meaſurable to a time that is finite, and ſo muſt have an end: or if to avoid this end, wee muſt ſuppoſe that the time muſt be infinite, yet ſo an infinite meaſure muſt be neceſſary, to meaſure thoſe parts that are finite. But this is impoſſible, and therefore the generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men muſt needs be finite. And if the generation of man-kind muſt have an end, then alſo all this creature which was made for his ſake; for after him, the continuance thereof ſhould be to no uſe; but neither the worke of God, nor of Nature His ſervant can be in vaine. Therefore the generation of man-kind is finite.</p>

And this anſwere ſhall be the firſt argument againſt thoſe mockers, that ſay, where is the promiſe of His comming?</p>

But the firſt is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, as it will appeare in that Article of the Reſurrection. Therefore alſo that there bee a judgement of the quicke and the dead.</p>

Neither is it ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that every mans deeds be diſcuſſed in the particular judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at his death; for ſo neither their deeds nor rewards, nor the cauſes of them ſhould be knowne unto all; Therefore it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that there be a generall judgement.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. If there be not a generall judgement wherein the deeds of all men ſhall be tryed and rewarded, then the hope of all vertuous men ſhould be vtterly void, and their obedience to the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of Meekneſſe and Patience, without reward, <hi>See Matth.</hi> 5.43. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.27, 28, &amp;c. So alſo the promiſes of <hi>Christ</hi> ſhould faile of their trueth and performance, <hi>See Matth.</hi> 5.10. but theſe things are impoſſible. So alſo vertue ſhould have no aduantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove vice, or rather ſhould be no vertue at all, when there were no difference in the reward. Nay, rather vertue ſhould be vice, and and vice vertue, and every man the more wicked, violent, and bold he were, ſhould be ſo much the more vertuous and bleſſed, in as much as by violence and cruelty, he might without feare bring his purpoſes to paſſe, to the hurt of others, although it were onely to pleaſe himſelfe. But all theſe things are impoſſible, and utterly againſt the truth and Iuſtice of God. Therefore there ſhall be a generall judgement, wherein the deeds of all men ſhall be tryed and rewarded.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. That which was threatned from the beginning, by God Himſelfe, muſt of neceſſity come to paſſe at the laſt. But the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was threatned to <hi>Adam,</hi> the common father of us all, and in him, againſt us all, becauſe we were all in him originally; that upon the breach of the commandement of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. we ſhould be
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:107656:164"/>lyable to death, both of body and ſoule. Neither was this onely threatned at the beginning, but ever ſince written as it were by the finger of God in every mans heart, their owne conſciences accuſing or excuſing them in the day when God ſhall judge the ſecrets of all men by <hi>Ieſus Chriſt. Rom.</hi> 2.15, 16. Therefore there ſhall be a judgement.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. It is neceſſary, that the judgements of God done in this world, doe appeare to be juſt: <hi>For ſhall not the Iudge of all the world doe right? Geneſ.</hi> 18.25. But many of His judgements are yet hid, and unknowne, and of them that are knowne, yet the faithfull doe not alwayes ſee the reaſon thereof, and ſo the praiſe which is due unto God for His juſtice therein is loſt. But it is neceſſary that the equity and juſtice of God be manifeſt to all, that His workes may be magnified and He acknowledged to be juſt in His words, and pure in His judgements. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.4. Therefore it is neceſſary, that there be a revelation of the righteous judgement of God in the world to come.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. No perfect judgement can be made of any thing, till the full end thereof doe appeare: ſo that although the life of man be end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and a particular judgement paſſed upon him; yet becauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things ſucceed in the time to come, which depend upon thoſe things which he hath done in his life; therefore it is neceſſary that there be a finall judgement at the laſt day, when thoſe dependan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces alſo ſhall have an end. For in reſpect of theſe dependances, a man may bee ſaid to live after his body is dead, and that in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers reſpects; As in his fame, either good or bad, which oftentimes is very falſe, but at the laſt judgement the trueth ſhall appeare: then in his writings, as the holy Prophets and the Apoſtles live in thoſe Oracles which the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> gave out by them. So <hi>Arius</hi> and other Heretickes live yet in thoſe venomous opinions which they broached, and other vaine people doe hold after them. So pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents live by the example of their life, to the inſtruction, or corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their children <hi>(Maxima debetur pueris reverentia)</hi> So by their correction and precepts to them, in the feare and nurture of the Lord, or by the neglect thereof to their deſtruction. Doe you not heare me, ye fooliſh and wicked parents? know you not yet that you ſhall anſwere for that wickedneſſe of your children, which they ſhall doe through your default? And if there be any other way whereby a man may be ſaid to live, as in the furthering of good lawes: So a man lives in his buildings, or in the havocke of that eſtate which his Anceſtors diſpoſed to the uſe of his children, in new faſhions daily deviſed worſe and worſe, and if there be any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing which remaines for example, either good or bad, after death, it is neceſſary that it be enquired of, and rewarded in the laſt judgement.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. If there be not a generall judgement, in which the bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the faithfull, both in ſoule and body ſhall be perfected, then
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:107656:165"/>the ſufferings of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and thoſe glories that followed thereon, ſhould be to no end, ſeeing He being in Himſelfe God bleſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, neither ſuffered nor did any of all that which was wrought in His manhood, for any increaſe of happines to Himſelfe, for that was impoſſible, but that the benefit thereof might be manifeſt in us. But this cannot be till the generall judgement: For then ſhall the wicked ſee that there is a reward for the righteous; Then ſhall they know that there is a God that judgeth the earth. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 58.11. Reade hereto, <hi>Wiſd. Chap.</hi> 5.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. All the dignities of God, have heretofore beene proved to be infinite, therefore alſo His juſtice; which ſhould be defective, if it had not given a perfect rule, according to which, all judgements ought to be guided: and if it did not examine all judgements, thereby to ratifie or cancell them. And becauſe not onely the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of publike juſtice is with judgement, but alſo every particular action whereto the will doth conſent; therefore it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that there be an univerſall judgement, wherein all judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and actions of men ſhall be examined and rewarded. From this juſtice alſo it followeth, that it ought to be well with the good, and ill with the wicked. And becauſe for the moſt part, it falles out contrary in this life, therefore it is neceſſary ſo to be in the life to come. <hi>See</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.5, 6, 7.</p>
                        <p n="10">10 And becauſe judgement is not fully executed according to juſtice in this world upon many offenders, in great and grievous, and hidden ſinnes, and that eſpecially on great perſons, who live as they liſt, oppreſſe others, and hold themſelues beyond the compaſſe of all lawes: And moreover, becauſe in this ſtate of mortality, man is not able to endure that puniſhment which is due to His ſinne; therefore is it neceſſary, in the juſtice of God, that ſuch ſinnes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not repented of, ſhould be openly and fully puniſhed in the world to come, as it is ſaid, <hi>Eſay</hi> 30.33. <hi>Tophet is ordained of old: yea, for the King it is prepared: He hath made it deepe and large, the pyle thereof is fire and much wood; the breath of the Lord, like a ſtreame of brimſtone, doth kindle it.</hi> Therefore there ſhall be a generall judgement.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. And if you will admit of an argument inductive, it may eaſily be admitted, that there ſhall be a generall judgement at the end of the world, by that ſeverity which God hath ſo often ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and doth ſhew, againſt ſinners, to put men in remembrance of that great day; As the drowning of the world, for their cruelty, in the dayes of <hi>Noah;</hi> The overthrow of <hi>Sodom,</hi> for their unnaturall luſt; The captivity of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> for their ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry; And at laſt, the utter caſting off of that nation for their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe; The publike calamities of Plague, Warres, Earthquakes, and overflowings of Waters, to the overthrowing of Cities and Countreys, famine and death, every houre, attending on every man in his greateſt ſecurity, are ſo many ſummons to every man to think
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:107656:165"/>on that day. For as the pilgrimage of Iſrael in the wilderneſſe was the type of our pilgrimage in this world; ſo their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were types unto us. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.11. But there is no type but of ſome thing which is to be indeed: So that the deſtruction of the people in the wilderneſſe, were both to them, and eſpecially to us on whom the ends of the world are come, an aſſured argument of this great judgement at the laſt day. And as the carcaſſes of them that were diſobedient, fell in the wilderneſſe, whereas the reſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the promiſed land; So all thoſe puniſhments that were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, bring to the faithfull an aſſured hope that God will deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them. For <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> were ſaved from deſtruction. <hi>Ebed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech</hi> and <hi>Baruch</hi> had their lives given as a prey. <hi>Ezechiel, Daniel,</hi> and they that were ſignified by the basket of good figges, <hi>Iere.</hi> 24.5. were carryed away for their good. The Chriſtians likewiſe were ſafe at <hi>Pella,</hi> in the deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem. Euſeb: Eccleſiaſt: hist: lib.</hi> 3 <hi>Cap.</hi> 5. So He delivereth from the noy ſome peſtilence. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 91.3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in the dayes of famine, thoſe that wait on Him ſhall have enough. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.19. So theſe things are teſtimonies unto us, both that there ſhall be a judgement, and that the godly ſhall be ſaved, and the wicked condemned.</p>
                        <p n="12">12 And as if nature if ſelfe had imprinted the acknowledgment of this judgement in every mans mind; ſo there was never any man <hi>(c)</hi> that confeſſed the reſurrection, but did withall confeſſe this generall judgement. And therefore, though every other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of our Creed have been impugned by ſome hereticke or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet never any gaineſayd this, I meane ſince thoſe errours were ſtilled in the Apoſtles time. <hi>See</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3.

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, though I have ſaid that which may be ſufficient, at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Chapter; yet becauſe it is our ſpeciall hope and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that He ſhall be our judge, that was our Creator, that hath ſo dearely bought us, that hath been our Mediator, that doth ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more preſerue us from the power of the enemy; let us both begin and end with this, leſt the conſcience of our owne ſinnes, and the remembrance of that fearefull time, ſhould cauſe us not to long for that comming. For if God be very terrible in the aſſembly of His Saints, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 89.7. how much more in that gloomy day, when He comes to render vengeance with devouring fire before Him, and to repay His aduerſaries to their face? and to paſſe on them, that fearefull ſentence, that ſhall <hi>(d)</hi> never be reverſed, and from which there is no appeale? But lift up your heads, you that are little in your owne eyes, and tremble at His words, for that is the day of your redemption, and God Himſelfe will come and ſave you. And becauſe He is God, He knowes the ſecrets of your hearts, and ſees your reverence and your feare before Him, and your acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your owne unworthineſſe: And becauſe He is man, and hath had experience of ſorrowes, and paſſed under the burden of unjuſt and cruell judgement, and hath for us endured the Croſſe and ſhame, that we might be delivered from the wrath to come: therefore lift up your heads, and receive the reward of your faith and patience; and the end of your hopes, the eternall ſaluation of your ſoules and bodies.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. For if our Lord having ſuffered ſuch things for us, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving overcome in all His ſufferings, having aſcended into heaven, to be our continuall interceſſor for us, ſhould not then give unto us that everlaſting life which He hath purchaſed for us; His ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and interceſſion ſhould be altogether in vaine, and our faith in Him, which He hath wrought in us by His holy Spirit, ſhould be utterly void; and thoſe promiſes which Hee hath giuen us in His holy Word, ſhould faile of their trueth and performance. But all theſe things are impoſſible. And therefore our Lord <hi>Ieſus</hi> ſhall come to give reward unto His ſeruants, both ſmall and great, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.18. and to caſt out the unbeleevers out of His kingdome.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In things that are orderly diſpoſed for an end, nothing may be omitted of thoſe things that are neceſſary for the attaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that end. The end of our Lords incarnation and ſufferings concernes either God or man. Concerning mankind, euerlaſting life in all happineſſe and joy, is that great end for which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our was incarnate, died, and roſe againe, and ſhall raiſe us up at the laſt day; And by His judgement of mercy and compaſſion on us, ſhall deliver unto us the ſeiſure and poſſeſſion of that eternall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe. Therefore our Lord <hi>Ieſus</hi> ſhall be judge of the quicke and the dead. Concerning God, it is neceſſary that in His love to His
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:107656:166"/>Father and zeale to His honour, Hee take vengeance on them that have offended the infinite juſtice, and deſpiſed that mercy and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don which hath beene offered unto them, and ſtill have continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their ſin, and followed it with greedineſſe. Therefore in this reſpect alſo, our Lord <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> ſhall be the Iudge of the quicke and the dead.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. And ſeeing our Lord <hi>Ieſus</hi> hath undertaken that honourable enterpriſe viterly to deſtroy the workes of the devill, it is neceſſary that He leave nothing unperformed, which doth belong to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment thereof. Therefore Hee ſhall judge thoſe Angels which are reſerved in chaines of darkneſſe unto that day, and bring upon them that deſtruction which they ſought to bring upon all man-kind; And ſhall alſo reward thoſe ſervants of His, which have continued faithfull in His ſervice, whether they be Angels or men.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. None is ſo fit to judge betweene two, as hee that hath inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in both parties, and knowes the worthineſſe of them both, and that not onely in his underſtanding, but alſo by his experience of them both. But man-kind is to be judged for that which hee hath done contrary or according to the will of God. Therefore ſeeing our Lord <hi>Ieſus</hi> is very God and very man (as it hath beene prooved) Hee ſhall be the judge of the quicke and the dead.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. In every orderly and juſt judgement, both the Iudge and the ſentence ought to be manifeſt and knowne to all them that are to be judged. And becauſe man-kind is to bee ſentenced to joy or paine eternall, both in ſoule and body: And that if either the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Father, or of the <hi>Holy-Ghost</hi> ſhould judge, otherwayes than by the Son, as they are no way to bee apprehended by the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſences of the wicked: ſo neither could the judge be ſeene, nor the ſentence heard; Therefore it is neceſſary that our Lord <hi>Ieſus</hi> doe execute the generall judgement, as being the Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God, and His creature, And that the performance of that judgement bee by Him in His manly being, as it is ſaid, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.27. 1. For ſeeing the exaltation and glory of <hi>Christ</hi> is the reward of His humilitie, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8.9. it is juſt with God, that He that was moſt unjuſtly judged, ſhould be the Iudge of all the world. 2. Moreover, ſeeing He hath received power to raiſe the dead, for that which He performed in His man-hood, it is fit that the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be by Him in His man-hood. 3. And ſeeing in His manly being, He taught the way to everlaſting life; it is fit that He in His manly being, ſhould require of us an account of the practiſe of His precepts.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. None is ſo fit to judge the world, as He in whom the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of juſtice, and compaſſion on man-kind are accorded. Our Lord <hi>Ieſus</hi> becauſe He is God, is infinite in His juſtice: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe He is man, and knowes mans weakeneſſe, better than man himſelfe; therefore can none be ſo mercifull and compaſſionate on
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:107656:167"/>man as He, eſpecially, having Himſelfe beene oppreſſed by the moſt unjuſt judgements of the Prieſts, and of <hi>Pilate.</hi> Therefore our Lord <hi>Ieſus</hi> ſhall judge the quicke and the dead: For being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced innocent, and yet condemned, <hi>Iohn</hi> 18.38. and 19.6.16. Hee hath power to acquit them that are condemned in themſelues, and to give them His innocencie, that it may bee availeable to them, which was not availeable to Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
                        <p n="7">7.

Some concerning the fignes, and circumſtances that goe before it; As whether that fire which goes before the face of the judge, be it, by which the Heaven and earth ſhall be purged. Some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the adjuncts of the judgement, as concerning the place, whether it ſhall be in the valley of <hi>Iehoſhaphat;</hi> For which they bring <hi>Ioel,</hi> 3. <hi>verſe</hi> 2. and 12. And reaſon that He ſhall judge there where He was judged, and deſpitefully entreated. For this valley is betweene <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and <hi>Mount Olivet,</hi> over which our Lord was led to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> after He was taken in the cloſe of <hi>Gethſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,</hi> which valley ſome ſuppoſe to bee named of <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> the King; and that becauſe he gave thankes there with his Armie, after his ſpoile of the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. But the circumſtances of the hiſtory accord not well with this, but rather that that valley of <hi>Barachah,</hi> where the King gave thankes, was in the Tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> neere to the wilderneſſe of <hi>Ieruel,</hi> as <hi>Adrichomius</hi> deſcribes it from <hi>Ierom, Brocard,</hi> and others. But this being put, that the Lord ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend from heaven to judge; whereſoever He ſhall judge, according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the Name <hi>lehova is Iudge,</hi> there is the valley of <hi>Ichoſhaphat,</hi> which the Prophet therfore mentioneth, becauſe that valley was the uſuall place where they buryed the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that died at <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> So they move queſtion heere, what cauſes and perſons ſhall come into Iudgement? And the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of the judgement they enquire, what manner of fire the fire of hell is; and ſuppoſing it to bee bodily, to torment the bodies of the damned, how the devills, which they ſuppoſe to be purely Spirits, can be tormented by a bodily
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:107656:167"/>fire. And hereupon alſo, they move doubt about the qualities of the bodies which (according to the opinion of the <hi>Stoicks</hi> concerning the ſoules, <hi>Lactant. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 20. to the damned they thinke, ſhall be baſe and ſubject to paſsion, to the bleſſed contrary; with many ſuch curious queſtions, as you may ſee in <hi>Tho.

                           <p n="1">1. And firſt becauſe the ill angels were utterly given over for their ſinne, and they by their malice confirmed onely in ill, their actions being ever unanſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and they before-hand condemned, therfore it may ſeeme that there ſhall be no enquirie of their actions, but onely the ſentence of condemnation is to paſſe upon them, and accordingly the execution: So the good Angels, becauſe they have beene kept from ſinne, and confirmed in goodneſſe, are exempted from enquiry of their actions, being onely good: ſo they ſhall have the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of approbation.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Concerning Inſants, there is much more queſtion. For ſome will have all the Infants of infidels to bee damned: others put to them the infants of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers alſo that were never baptized: And this hard ſentence is paſſed on them, becauſe their originall ſinne was never waſhed away in baptiſme: But ſeeing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall guiltineſſe in Infants is onely by the ſtaine of nature, that the whole world may be guilty before God, and ſo be the ſubject of His mercie, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19. may it not ſtand as well with the mercy of God, that the faith of their Parents ſhould bee imputed to them for their juſtification unto life, although they were not baptized, as it doth ſtand with His juſtice to condemne them, becauſe they are tainted by their Parents?

Therefore the body ſhall riſe againe. At laſt, conferring with my reverend and learned friend, Maſter <hi>R.

                        <p>§ 1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He word <hi>Ghost</hi> in Engliſh, our true ſpeech; is as much as <hi>athem,</hi> or breath; in our new Latine language, a Spirit. The metaphoricall uſe of it, as it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a qualitie, as wee ſay, the Spirit of meekneſſe, of jealouſie, of pride, or that ſpirit of 7. devills, which troubles and overturnes the ſtate of the world, which God doth hate above all other, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.3. I meane the ſpirit of covetouſneſſe hath no place here: nor yet the word, ſpirit, as it may meane any being elementall, as we ſpeake of the winde, or any ſubtile ſteame raiſed from a moiſt body: nor yet as it ſignifies thoſe created e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereall ſpirits, which wee call Angels: but onely as our Lord ſpeakes, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.24. <hi>God is a Spirit,</hi> which as it is ſpoken of the God-head eſſentially: ſo heere wee confeſſe that wee beleeve in the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> or <hi>Spirit,</hi> that third Perſon in the glorious Trinity, our God, our Sanctifier, our Comforter, eternally one with the Father, and the Sonne, unto whoſe faith and ſervice onely wee are bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, as our Saviour commanded, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Goe teach all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Sonne, and of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Ghoſt.</hi>
                           <pb n="114" facs="tcp:107656:171"/>As faſt as our heavy-footed reaſon can follow our faith, I have in the 10, 11, and 12. <hi>Chapter,</hi> and <hi>Notes</hi> thereon, already ſhewed the diſtinct ſubſtances of the three Perſon in the unity of their eſſence, ſo that it ſeemes there is nothing in this place need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to that point, but onely to bring thoſe Scriptures which doe directly prove the God-head of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> and that Hee doth proceede from the Father and the Sonne. For the firſt, you may take theſe Texts, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.7. <hi>There are three that beare witneſſe in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and theſe three are one. Actes</hi> 5.3.4. <hi>Why hath Satan fill'd thy heart, that thou ſhouldeſt lie unto the Holy-Ghost? Thou haſt not lyed unto men, but unto God. Mark.</hi> 3.29. <hi>He that ſhall blaſpheme againſt the Holy-Ghoſt, hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver forgiveneſſe, but is in danger of eternall damnation. Therefore the Holy-Ghost is God.</hi> Take hereto texts brought, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. §. 3. <hi>num.</hi> 9. By all which Scriptures it is manifeſt, that the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> is God coeſſentiall with the Father, and the Sonne, and therefore to be worſhipped and glorified with the ſame glory with them. And that He doth proceed from the Father and the Sonne, theſe texts doe make it plaine, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.26. <hi>When the Comforter is come whom I, will ſend unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of trueth which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from the Father, Hee will teſtifie of mee.</hi> And <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.7. <hi>If I depart, I will ſend the Comforter unto you. Rom.</hi> 8.9. He is called the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of <hi>Christ. Gal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Becauſe yee are ſonnes; God hath ſent the Spirit of His Sonne into your hearts, crying Abba Father. See Rev.</hi> 5.6. and <hi>Iohn</hi> 20.22. <hi>Hee breathed on them and ſaid, Receive ye the Holy-Ghoſt.</hi> By which it is manifeſt, that the <hi>Holy-Ghost</hi> proceedeth from Him. And this is that Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that dwelleth in us, and that not onely by His graces, and gifts in us; nor onely as God every where preſent, that worketh all in all; but alſo as in thoſe Temples which He hath ſanctified for His per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall dwelling, as it is ſaid, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19. <hi>Know yee not that your bodie is the temple of the Holy-Ghoſt, which is in you?</hi> Neither doth the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> onely dwell with them whom He hath ſanctified un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Himſelfe, but together with Him, both the Father and the Son, as it is ſaid, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.16. <hi>I will pray the Father, and Hee ſhall give you another comforter, even the Spirit of trueth, that Hee may abide with you for ever;</hi> And againe, <hi>verſe</hi> 23. <hi>If a man love mee, hee will keepe my wordes: and my Father will love him, and wee will come unto him, and make our abode with him.</hi> And thus is the Tabernacle of God with men, and thus doth He dwell among them. Therefore let us remember that precept. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30. <hi>Not to grieve that Holy Spirit (by our willfull ſinnes) whereby wee are ſealed to the day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption:</hi> For if any man defile the Temple of God, him will God deſtroy, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17. <hi>This is the ſeale and pledge of our eternall hope: For if the ſpirit of Him that raiſed up Ieſus from the dead doth dwell in us, He ſhall alſo quicken our mortall bodies by His Spirit that dwelleth in us, as I ſhewed more fully, Chap.</hi> 17. §. 4. <hi>num.</hi> 2. Neither indeed
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:107656:171"/>were it any aſſurance of hope or comfort to know and beleeve that God the Father created all things by <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and that <hi>Christ</hi> the Sonne of God died for the ſinnes of men, (for ſo much the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills acknowledge) except wee did alſo know and beleeve that the fruite and effect of that redemption did belong to every beleever in particular, and that in the eternall purpoſe of God, wee were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto this hope. And this faith and knowledge is wrought in us only by the <hi>Holy-Ghost,</hi> as you may read, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.13.14. and <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. from <hi>verſe</hi> 17. to the end. Neither yet could wee have ſure conſolation in this witneſſe of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> unto our hearts, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept wee did certainely know that this <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> which witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth theſe things unto us, were God, who cannot lie. Whereof wee have full proofe by thoſe graces which Hee worketh in us; as firſt the knowledge of the trueth; then faith to beleeve it; then as living water, doth he waſh our conſciences from ſinne; then (as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Evangeliſt ſpeaketh) doth Hee as fire, inflame our hearts with the love of God, a hatred of ſinne, and a deſire to walke in newneſſe of life: and although wee be daily aſſaulted by the world, and the devill, to whom wee are often betrayed by our owne wicked imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; ye doth He not forſake us for ever; but when wee ſee our ſelves to have no ſtrength of our ſelues, to ſtand in the leaſt temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and ſo have learned not to truſt in our ſelves, but in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, and to deſire His helpe; then doth He returne and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort us in all the troubles of our mind, and even in death it ſelfe, makes us more than conquerors. Oh what is man, that thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt take ſuch tender care of Him, or the ſonne of ſinfull fleſh! that thou ſhouldeſt ſo viſit him? Now it is impoſſible that any created Spirit, at one time, in all places of the world, and that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſince God created man upon the earth, even unto the laſt man that ſhall be borne, ſhould worke theſe different effects in the hearts of all Gods children: And therefore the <hi>Holy-Ghost</hi> is God. And His witneſſe in our hearts that wee are the ſonnes of God, is an eternall trueth, and ſuch as hath neither falſhood nor doubt, nor double meaning.</p>
                        <p>§. 2.1. But you will ſay, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> if the word <hi>Spirit</hi> belong eſſentially to all the Perſons of the God-head, and that they bee all holineſſe it ſelfe, as it is ſaid, <hi>Eſ.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord of Hostes,</hi> how is it here appropriated to the third Perſon? Is not the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Perſons taken away hereby, ſeeing every one is a Holy Spirit? <hi>I anſwere.</hi> That in this place, as in many other texts of Holy Scripture, the words, <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> are taken relatively or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally, as they meane that third Perſon of the <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> with that relation of proceſſion which He hath from the Father and the Son, as it was ſhewed <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. <hi>Re.</hi> 8.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. But it is ſaid, <hi>Iohn</hi> 7.39. That the <hi>Holy-Ghost</hi> was not yet; which takes away His eternity, and ſo His God-head.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſwere.</hi> Tropes and figures are uſuall in every language,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:107656:172"/>though not minded by the vulgar ſort. So here is a <hi>Metonymia,</hi> or taking of the author for the gifts of divers tongues, miracles, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie, and ſuch like, and theſe gifts were not yet given, as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes in the text, becauſe that <hi>Ieſus</hi> was not yet glorified: that it might appeare to all, that theſe were His gifts, who was before cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified. Compare herewith, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.7. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4.8. and 11.1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>(a)</hi> If the proceſſion of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> bee perfect from the Father, then doth Hee not proceed from the Sonne; or if it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that He proceede from the Sonne alſo, then muſt there bee in Him ſomething of compoſition, of ſuperaddition, or the like, whereby his being ſhould not be moſt ſimple, which were to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Him to be God. So alſo the proceſſion from the firſt principle not being perfect, would argue a defect therein.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſwere.</hi> This is as if you ſhould reaſon thus. If the way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Thebes</hi> and <hi>Athens,</hi> be the ready way from <hi>Thebes</hi> to <hi>Athens,</hi> then can it not be the way from <hi>Athens</hi> to <hi>Thebes.</hi> But I ſay that the proceſſion, emanation, or out-flowing of the <hi>Holy-Ghost</hi> from the Father, is moſt perfect infinite, and eternall, as from that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from which the proceſſion is actively, as the action of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is in, and yet from the mind which doth underſtand, as from the active principle. But the proceſſion, or emanation of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> from the Sonne, is likewiſe infinite, and eternall, as from the paſſive principle, as the underſtanding is from that object which is underſtood. And ſo the proceſſion of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> is perfect, infinite and eternall, both from the Father and the Sonne. And becauſe all this is in the God-head onely (for I ſpeake not now of thoſe graces and mercies which are from God upon the creature) therefore it is neceſſary that the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> be God bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed above all, infinitely and eternally, one being with the Father and the Sonne.</p>
                        <p>You will heere aske me what the difference is betweene genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby the Sonne is from the Father, and proceſſion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the <hi>Holy-Ghost</hi> is from the Father and the Son? If I confeſſe that I can neither ſpeake nor conceive it, you muſt hold me excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: For in thoſe things that are not lawfull, nor poſſible for the creature to know, it is not fit to enquire. But you may remember that heretofore, although we concluded according to the rule of trueth, the Holy Scripture, that all the Perſons in the Holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, were in their abſolute being one; yet by the ſame rule, and the enforcement of reaſon we were compelled to yeeld unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as concerning His Perſonal being, the precedence of originall, as being that fountaine of life and glory, from which the other Perſons doe proceede. And becauſe our Lord <hi>Ieſus</hi> is the expreſſe Image of the Father, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. whoſe proceſſion or going forth is from eternity, <hi>Mich.</hi> 5.2. and He by the ſtile of the Holy Scripture, called the Sonne of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.7. therefore doe wee attribute
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:107656:172"/>unto Him, as concerning His Perſonall being, the word of genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or being begotten; yet in reſpect of His abſolute eſſence, wherein He is one with the Father, He is alſo called the everlaſting Father, <hi>Eſay</hi> 9.6. But becauſe all things in the Godhead are in the infinitie of perfection, and that the being of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> is alike both from the Father and the Son; and that no perfect being hath two Fathers, therefore is His perſonall being ſaid to be rather by proceſsion then by generation.</p>
                        <p>§ 3. And becauſe this Article is the laſt in our Creed, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> whereby we confeſſe our faith in the holy Trinity, it will not be unfit to take up in briefe, that which we have ſpoken hereunto at large.</p>
                        <p>It is manifeſt unto all reaſon, that nothing can be a cauſe, and yet not be; for that would bring a contradiction, which the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the foole of fooles, I meane the <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, that a thing that hath no manner of being, ſhould bee of ſuch powerfull being, as that it ſhould cauſe, either it ſelfe, or another thing, to be. And becauſe we ſee that divers things are, which could not cauſe themſelues to be, when they were not; it followes neceſſarily, that there were cauſes of their being, and that all their cauſes did worke as they were ordered and mooved by their firſt cauſe: which (ſeeing it is the cauſe of all beings) muſt of it ſelfe not onely be; but alſo have power both to be of it ſelfe, and alſo to moove all other cauſes to worke to their determinate ends. And this moſt excellent and firſt being, the cauſe of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is that which we call God, in whom (you ſee) the firſt thing which we can underſtand, is, <hi>to be:</hi> but that eternally, becauſe there is nothing before Him which might give Him His being; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely, becauſe there was nothing which could put any bounds to His being. The next thing that we can underſtand of God, is, that He hath power both to be and to worke; but no worke or action can be, but in that which hath both actuall being, and alſo power to worke. And if from hence I ſhould conclude a Trinity of Perſons, in the unity of that one powerfull and active being; the whole creature would ſay, <hi>Amen.</hi> For as every effect is anſwerable to the cauſe, and by that voyce which it hath, ſhewes what the cauſe was; ſo you ſhall finde that every created being hath in it matier, or that which is proportionable thereto, which is as the ſimple being thereof; then forme whereby it hath power to worke, and laſtly working according to that property which ariſeth from the matier and the forme. For as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of mankind, ſo is it true in every thing, That, <hi>In Him,</hi> or <hi>By Him, we moove,</hi> that is, our action, <hi>and Live,</hi> that is the power from whence our action ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, <hi>and Are,</hi> that is the foundation of both the other. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this argument would be but inductive, therefore I referre you to the 11. <hi>Chapter</hi> before, for further proofe of the Trinity of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in unity of the Godhead. Returne then to where you left. GOD is the firſt of beings, and therefore eternall <hi>à parte antè,</hi> for
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:107656:173"/>otherwiſe ſomething ſhould have beene before Him, which ſhould have cauſed Him to be: but we conſented to the contrary before. And if He be the firſt of beings, then nothing made by Him, can be greater then He, by whoſe power He might be brought to nothing; And therefore He is eternall <hi>à parte poſt,</hi> to endure for ever eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally. And if God be the firſt of all beings; then it is neceſſary that His being be moſt ſimple and pure, as having nothing therein of any dependance of another, unto whom either matier, forme, compoſition, accident, or any poſſibility to be either more, leſſer, greater, or other then He is, can any way belong. And if God be eternall, it followes neceſſarily, that He have infinite power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue eternally. But an infinite power cannot be but in an infinite being, therefore His being is infinite. And becauſe nothing can be in His moſt ſimple being, but that which is eſſentially Himſelfe; therefore infinitie muſt be His being, and His being, infinitie. And if God be infinite in His being, then it is impoſſible that any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of being ſhould be wanting to His being, for ſo His being could not be infinite. And therefore, Wiſedome, Goodneſſe, Trueth, Glory, and all other excellencies of being, are in Him infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely, perfectly, and eternally. And becauſe no abatement, want, or littleneſſe can be in infinitie, therefore is it neceſſary that all thoſe perfections which are in God, be alſo active or working in Him, for otherwiſe they could cauſe no joy or happines unto Him, ſo ſhould they be unto him in want and defect, and not in infinity. Therefore it is neceſſary that all thoſe perfections that are in God, be not onely active in Him, but alſo as infinite in their action, as they are in their being, leſt a twofold being, one in the greatneſſe of being, and another in leſſeneſſe of action ſhould be in God, which is utterly impoſſible. But becauſe no action can be where there is no object to worke upon, nor no infinite action where there is not an infinite object; therefore it is neceſſary that there be an infinite object of all that glorious action which is in God, whereby He works infinitely and eternally. And this infinite object, is that glorious Sonne of His love, the image of Himſelfe, wherein all His per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is actuated and expreſſed: and that infinite action whereby the Sonne is Characterized, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.3. Formed, <hi>See Eſay</hi> 43.10. or brought foorth eternally, is the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt.</hi> And becauſe there can be no action, where either the agent or object is wanting, therefore is the <hi>Holy-Ghost</hi> moſt truely ſaid to proceed from the Father and the Sonne. And becauſe I ſpeake onely of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable action which is in God Himſelfe, from whence the difference of the three Perſons doth ariſe; therefore you muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that as the action, ſo the Perſons alſo are in the Godhead eſſentially: and that not onely becauſe the action is according to the purity and perfection of the Divine being; but alſo becauſe all the termes thereof, that is, the Agent, the object, and the Action it ſelfe are infinite and eternall; which cannot poſſibly be found, out of the Godhead.</p>

                        <p>And thus in briefe you ſee it manifeſt, not onely that God is; but alſo that His being is infinite and eternall, with all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections both of being and working, and how from the infinitie of His glorious and eternall working, the Trinity of Perſons in the unity of the Godhead is concluded, and conſequently that the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> is God, eternally proceeding from the Father and the Sonne.

                              <hi>(a) IF the proceſſion of the Holy-Ghoſt.]</hi> The hereſies which have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this Article of our Creed, have beene many and great. For the more neceſſary any trueth is to be knowne and beleeved, the more damnable he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies hath the devill raiſed thereabout. But as the hereſies that were about our Lord <hi>Chriſt;</hi> ſo theſe here may be brought to three heads. The firſt concerne the perſon of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> § 1. The ſecond His being. § 2. The third His properties. § 3.</p>
                           <p>§ 1. Concerning the perſon of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt, Simon</hi> that eldeſt ſonne of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, would be all in all. For he ſaid, that he gave the Law to <hi>Moſes,</hi> in mount <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> in the perſon of the Father: that in the dayes of <hi>Tiberius</hi> he ſuffered in ſhew, under the Perſon of the Sonne: and that after he was that <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> that came upon the Apoſtles in the ſhew of cloven tongues. Thus ſaith <hi>Auguſtine Haer:</hi> 1. But <hi>Epiphanius Haer:</hi> 21. ſaith, that he called his Punke <hi>Helena,</hi> the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt;</hi> for whoſe deare ſake he transformed himſelfe, that he might come to her thorow all the heavens, unknowne of his angels. But this fellow preſuming too much on the power of his devills, while he tooke upon him to aſcend into heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, he died of the fall, and ſo the necke of his hereſie was broken.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Manes,</hi> a Perſian, the father of the <hi>Manichees,</hi> erred the ſame hereſie with <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> the Witch, and gave out himſelfe for the holy Spirit: but being ſlayed alive by the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> he found himſelfe to be a body, and not a ſpirit. <hi>Hierax</hi> an Egyptian Monke, affirmed that <hi>Melchizedek,</hi> of whom you reade, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. was the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt.</hi> Some there be that write concerning <hi>Montanus</hi> the <hi>Phrygian,</hi> that he tooke upon him to be the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt.</hi> But <hi>Euſebius lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 14. and <hi>Auguſtine Haer:</hi> 86. affirme that this hereſie was onely thus much, that he had received that Comforter which was promiſed <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.26. in greater meaſure then the Apoſtles; and in this his followers, the <hi>Cataphryges,</hi> and with them <hi>Tertullian</hi> himſelfe, as it appeares by ſome of his writings, did conſent to him. But <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> in that 48. hereſie, cites the words of <hi>montanus</hi> thus; <hi>I came, neither Angel nor Ambaſſador, but I am the Lord God, even the Father.</hi> Neither have theſe hereticks of old time, onely ſo madded themſelves; but with us of late, <hi>Wrightman</hi> gave out himſelfe for the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> as <hi>Hacket</hi> before him would needes bee <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But the diſcipline of <hi>Bedlem,</hi> or <hi>Bridewell,</hi> is fitteſt to teach ſuch ſenceleſſe people, not to ſet their mouthes againſt Heaven.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. But that which all theſe hereticks affirme, concerning the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly beyond all faith and poſsibility of being. Of faith, I ſay, becauſe neither <hi>Iewes,</hi> nor <hi>Turkes,</hi> which cannot beleeve a Trinity of Perſons in unity of the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:107656:174"/>Deitie, can never be brought to thinke that two of theſe Perſons ſhould bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate, when they will not receive Him that was approved of God by ſo many miracles, to bee <hi>God with us.</hi> Neither can the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> bee brought to beleeve that the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> ſhould bee incarnate, when there is not one word in the Holy Scripture whereupon they may ground any ſuch Article of their faith.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Beſide this, that which they affirme is utterly impoſsible. For nothing is poſsible to be in the Trinitie, which brings in any confuſion or diſorder. But if the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> ſhould be incarnate, then ſhould there not be one Sonne of God incarnate, but two ſonnes: but that were confuſion, and no way neceſſary, and therefore not poſsible. Compare herewith, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. and the <hi>Reaſons</hi> of the <hi>Chap.</hi> 23.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Moreover, the workes of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> are the workes of a moſt pure Spirit, whereto a humane body can no way give any furtherance, as to renew the mind by Repentance; to give faith; to teach and comfort the ſoule; to make it love that which is good, to hate that which is ill, and the like; All which, and whatſoever elſe the Holy Spirit doth worke, it worketh onely ſpiritually. Therefore it is neceſſary, or meet that the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> ſhould take on Him the body of man.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. That argument which <hi>Epiphanius, Haer.</hi> 66. uſed againſt <hi>Manes</hi> in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, may ſerve in generall againſt all the reſt. If <hi>Manues,</hi> ſaith he, were that <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Ghoſt</hi> whom the Lord promiſed to His diſciples, then that promiſe had beene in vaine, ſeeing that this hereſie of <hi>Manes</hi> was not heard of till 247. after the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> who alſo performed that gift of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> within tenne dayes after His aſcenſion. Neither was that hereſie of <hi>Montanus</hi> heard of, till about 140. yeeres after <hi>Chriſts</hi> aſcenſion. And whereas the diſciples were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded not to depart from <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> but to waite there for the promiſe that was to be fulfilled not many dayes after: This hereſie of <hi>Simon</hi> was not broach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed will after the diſciples were ſcattered from <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> by reaſon of the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that aroſe about <hi>Stephen,</hi> as ſome write in the ſixt yeere after the ſuffering of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Concerning <hi>Melchizedek,</hi> it is manifeſt that he was a Prieſt of the moſt high God; ſo was not the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt:</hi> For He onely beares witneſſe unto the faithfull ſoule, of <hi>Chriſts</hi> eternall Prieſt-hood. The madneſſe of <hi>Mahumed,</hi> you ſhall finde, <hi>Chap.</hi> 34. § 5. <hi>N.</hi> 8.</p>

                                 <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> Thus the doubt concerning thoſe perſons, who were pretended to be the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> being anſwered, it followes next to examine thoſe errours that have been about His being. Among theſe, the chiefe was that of <hi>Arius,</hi> who taught that the Son was the firſt and chiefe creature made by the Father, of that which was not. And that the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> was a creature of this creature. But becauſe the great queſtion with <hi>Arius</hi> was about the Sonne, this hereſie is imputed to <hi>Macedonius,</hi> a light fellow, fit for his trade, which they call the <hi>Feathermakers.</hi> From that he became a Prieſt, and after, the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Of him ſome write, that he held the hereſie of <hi>Arius</hi> whole: otherſome, that he held the true faith, concerning the Father and the Sonne; but erred concerning the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt.</hi> For ſome write that he held that the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> was not a Perſon ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in Himſelfe; but that the Deity of the Father and the Sonne, was that which we call the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt.</hi> Other write, that his hereſie was this; That the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> was the miniſter of God in the creature, or a certaine power created of God in every creature; becauſe it is ſaid in <hi>Amos</hi> 4.13. <hi>That God createth the Spirit.</hi> where, although it be manifeſt by that which goeth before, <hi>Hee hath formed the mountaines,</hi> that it is ſpoken of the mind; Yet that adulterate Synod at <hi>Lampſacus,</hi> from thence juſtified that errour of <hi>Macedonius,</hi> that the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> was a creature. For this hereſie, his followers were called <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap>, or fighters againſt the Holy Spirit. And although others were before him in this hereſie, as the <hi>Originiſts,</hi> the <hi>Arians,</hi> and <hi>Semiarians;</hi> yet becauſe he was a ſavage
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:107656:174"/>and a fierce man to them that thought not with him; therefore this opinion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came as it were his peculiar. His arguments were onely ſuch as <hi>Arius</hi> uſed, and therefore anſwered as they that were brought by him againſt the Deity of the Sonne, as 1. from that in <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.3. <hi>The Father is acknowledged the onely true God.</hi>

                              <hi>Anſwere</hi> 1. I have heretofore ſaid, that by the name of <hi>Father</hi> all the Perſons of the Trinitie are underſtood: and to this Father, that onely Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and man, the Man <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> confeſſeth in this place of Saint <hi>Iohn, See</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2, 3, 4, 5. and <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.6.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſwere</hi> 2. Moreover, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 3.14, 15. <hi>That of the Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, the whole familie in heaven and earth is named.</hi> So our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour heere to take away the opinion of moe gods than one, acknowledgeth that God His Father is that eternall Fountaine, from which both the Sonne and the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> doth proceede, as I have ſaid before: but yet ſeeing the being of the Father is moſt ſimple, and one; that which doth proceede eſſentially from that ſimple and pure being of His, muſt neceſſarily be all one and the ſame with Him. And therefore both the Sonne and the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> muſt needes bee God.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. <hi>Objection.</hi> All things were made by Him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.3. Therefore the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> alſo was made by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſo as the <hi>Arians</hi> ſpeake, Hee is a creature of a creature.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſwere.</hi> Thoſe words, <hi>All things,</hi> are interpreted by that which followes, <hi>without Him was not any thing made which was made.</hi> For if thoſe words, <hi>All things,</hi> ſhould be taken in that ſence as the Hereticks urge them, it ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that both the Father alſo, and the Sonne Himſelfe were made by Himſelfe, which are things impoſsible.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. <hi>Objection.</hi> He that receives of another, is inferior to Him of whom he doth receive. But the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> doth receive of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to ſhew unto His Church. Therefore He is inferiour unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and conſequently a creature.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſwere.</hi> The propoſition is falſe: For great Princes receive Preſents of their ſubjects, Lords of their Tenants, Maſters of their Scholars, who account it a favour, and an honour done unto them, that their offers are accepted. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that taking of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> from the Father and the Sonne, ſpoken of in that text of <hi>Iohn,</hi> 16.14. is not of grace, but by nature: neither is it any other thing than this. That as the Father from all eternity had decreed to reconcile the world unto Himſelfe, by the death of His Sonne, and that the Sonne accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly performed this in due time, by His death upon the Croſſe: So the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Sonne, by that Holy Spirit which proceedeth from them both, doth ſauctifie the hearts of the elect, and aſſure them that this reconciliation, with all the fruits and effects thereof, was for their eternall comfort and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For that peculiar manner of ſubſiſtence in the Divine nature, which He ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth from the Father and the Sonne, whereby it is moſt neceſſarily concluded that He is God, is not heere ſpoken of.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. <hi>Objection.</hi> The <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> is no where called God in the Scripture. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore He is a creature.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſwere</hi> 1. He is no where in the Scripture called a creature, or mentioned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the creatures in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148. or elſe-where. Therefore He is God.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſwer</hi> 2. The propoſition is falſe, as it appeared by the texts cited out of <hi>Actes</hi> 5.3, 4. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. where He is equalled with the Father and the Sonne, and 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.14. And <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.7. Moreover, no ſinne doth make a man lyable to an infinite puniſhment, but that which is againſt an infinite being. But the ſinne againſt the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> ſhall not bee pardoned, neither in this world, nor yet in that which is to come, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.32. Therefore the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> is God. Take hereto, <hi>Actes</hi> 28. <hi>verſo</hi> 25. and 27. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.8. and 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. And as theſe texts of Scripture are ſufficient, to ſhew the falſhood of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:107656:175"/>this laſt objection: So doe they manifeſt the vanitie of all the reſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme abundantly the trueth of this Article, that the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> is God.</p>
                           <p>To bring the conſent of Fathers, and Councelis to theſe Scriptures, were as to encreaſe the light of the Sun by a burning candle: yet becauſe it was ſo plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared in the firſt generall Councell held at <hi>Nice,</hi> by 318. Fathers, in the yeere of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> 325. you may remember it, if you will. In that Councell, this Article was thus declared in that forme of confeſsion, which was framed by <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Corduba. As the Father and the Sonne,</hi> ſo alſo the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> ſubſiſteth with them, of the ſame being, of the ſame power of which they are. And a little after. <hi>Wee ought to confeſſe one God-head, one being of the Father, of the Sonne, and of the Holy-Ghoſt;</hi> not teaching any confuſion or diviſion of the Perſons of the unſpeakeable and bleſſed Trinitie. But according to the integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of that faith and doctrine which was heretofore delivered by the Lord Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to His Apoſtles, and hath beene ſincerely taught to us by our holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who kept it pure and intire, as they received it from the Apoſtles: wee beleeve and confeſſe the undivideable <hi>Trinitie,</hi> which cannot ſufficiently either be conceived in the underſtanding, or expreſſed in wordes; that is, the Father eternally and truely ſubſiſting, a true Father of a true Sonne; and the Sonne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally and truely ſubſiſting, a true Sonne of a true Father, and the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> verily and eternally ſubſiſting with them. And wee are ever ready by the power of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> to proove that this is the trueth, by the manifold teſtimony of the holy Scripture, <hi>Hiſtor. Gelasij Cyzie. Act. Conc. Nic. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. This faith was approved of all; but becauſe the preſent buſineſſe with <hi>Arius</hi> was eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially about the Sonne: For he held that the Son was not of the ſubſiſtence of the Father; nor yet very God. That they might meet fully with that errour, they agreed to that forme wherein it is confeſſed, that the Sonne is <hi>light of light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one ſubſtance with the Father, &amp;c.</hi> Thus having ended the controverſie about the God-head of the Sonne, they come to the queſtion of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt:</hi> againſt whom <hi>Phaedon</hi> a <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> and patron of <hi>Arius</hi> his cauſe, objected thus. It is no where written in the Scripture, that the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> is a Creater, and therefore Hee is not God. To which, the Councell oppoſed that which is in <hi>Iob</hi> 33.4. <hi>The Spirit of God hath made mee, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.</hi> And that in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.6. <hi>By the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the hoſts of them, by the Spirit of His mouth.</hi> To which they added that of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>verſe</hi> 4, 5, 6. where the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> is called both Lord, and God; And ſo concluded that all the three Perſons, that is, the Father, the Sonne, and the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> were <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap> conſubſtantiall, or of the ſame ſubſtance, <hi>Lib. Cit. Cap.</hi> 25. Likewiſe, when this hereſie of <hi>Arius</hi> concerning the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> was againe revived by <hi>Macedonius:</hi> the ſecond generall Councell held at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> in the yeere 381. condemned the hereſies of all <hi>Arians, Apollinariſts,</hi> and <hi>Macedenians,</hi> confirmed the faith profeſſed in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, and for further expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the trueth in this point to that clauſe, <hi>Wee believe in the Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> they added, <hi>the Lord and giver of life, who proceedeth from the Father—who with the Father and the Sonne, together is worſhipped and glorified, &amp;c.</hi> And this is ſufficient for the declaration of the trueth in this point, by the authority of generall Councells. All the orthodox Fathers conſent hereunto. Among whom, if you deſire to bee further acquainted with the arguments and objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on both ſides, you may reade the writings of that moſt noble Champion of the trueth of the holy Trinitie, <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and in ſpeciall, that ſermon of the humane nature, taken by the <hi>Word,</hi> the oration againſt the ging of <hi>Sabellius,</hi> and the firſt and ſecond Epiſtle to <hi>Serapion,</hi> and his firſt dialogue againſt <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> with him <hi>Macedonianus. See alſo Greg. Nyſſ. vol.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 439. <hi>edit. Pariſ.</hi> 1615. you may alſo (if you will) take theſe objections, and their anſweres, brought by <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> to this queſtion, <hi>Haer.</hi> 74. and with them, thoſe

                           <p>Another errour againſt the being of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> is that which they call of the later <hi>Greekes:</hi> and yet is not onely of the <hi>Grecians</hi> themſelves, but of all thoſe Nations and Peoples, that are of the juriſdiction of the Patriarch of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> which if you leave out the Countreys of the poore <hi>Painims</hi> in the Eaſt, and Weſt <hi>Indies,</hi> is far greater than the pretended univerſality of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> both in <hi>Europe,</hi> and in <hi>Aſia, See Brerew. Enq. Chap.</hi> 15. and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides them, the <hi>Melchites,</hi> or Chriſtians of <hi>Syria,</hi> the <hi>Armenians,</hi> and <hi>Maro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> hold the ſame hereſie. All theſe, though they confeſſe that the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> is God, the third Perſon in the Trinitie; yet they ſay, that He proceedeth onely from the Father, not from the Sonne. But although they account this but a later errour among the <hi>Greekes,</hi> perhaps becauſe the ſtirres thereabout after the Councell of <hi>Florence,</hi> in the yeere, 1439. grew more hot than they had beene before, and that becauſe the <hi>Greekes</hi> then preſent in that Councell, in hope to draw them of the Weſt into their helpe againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> did ſeemingly yeeld to that trueth which theſe Churches in the Weſt, doe holde in that point: yet it appeares, that in the time of <hi>Damaſcen,</hi> about the yeere, 750. it was their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived opinion: For thus he writes, <hi>Orthod. fidet. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 13. <hi>He is the Spirit of the Sonne, not proceeding from Him, but from the Father by Him.</hi> For the Father onely is the cauſe. Nay, if you looke yet higher, in that explanation which the Councell of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ſpoken of even now, made of that Article of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, that clauſe, <hi>and from the Sonne,</hi> is left out; ſo that this errour ſeemes not new, but falſhood is as ancient as the devills apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and no antiquitie can make it trueth. And if you looke to the authorities of Scripture, brought before to this point, in the <hi>Chap.</hi> §. 1. and conſider well the reaſons in <hi>Chapter</hi> 11. you ſhall ſee how rotten this opinion is, and how juſtly the clauſe, <hi>And from the Sonne,</hi> was added by the Latine Churches, as they declare it in that Councell of <hi>Florence,</hi> ſpoken of before.</p>
                           <p>So that falſhood which ſome write to <hi>Paulus</hi> of <hi>Samoſata,</hi> that the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> is not any divine ſubſiſtence, but onely the working and grace of God in the hearts of men: and that which they write of <hi>Servetus,</hi> that it is onely a certaine vigor or ſtrength whereby every thing created is mooved naturally; at the ſight of the ſame authorities and reaſons, will vaniſh as miſt before the wind. Thoſe childiſh fantaſies of the <hi>Elleaſites,</hi> or <hi>Sampſeans</hi> of which you read in <hi>Epiphanius, Haer.</hi> 30. and <hi>Haer.</hi> 53. would trouble your hearing.</p>
                           <p>§ 3. So the onely hereſie which is yet remaining, <label type="milestone">
                                 <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> is that which concernes the propriety or working of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt.</hi> Concorning whom, ſome affirmed, that He was not given ſufficiently to the Apoſtles, and that therefore, further revelations were neceſſary to be made by them that had greater meaſure of that gift. The <hi>Cataphryges</hi> or diſciples of <hi>Montanus,</hi> and the <hi>Manichees</hi> muſt needs be chiefe herein: For if they had held that the gifts of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> had beene given to the Apoſtles ſufficiently, their fancies of their new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forters, to teach them more then was needfull, had never beene hatcht. And among theſe, <hi>Tertullian</hi> was moſt too blame, who having once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted the <hi>Montaniſts,</hi> di afterward both follow their errour and defend it. But if that Holy Spirit ſhould leade the Apoſtles into all trueth, yea, and ſhew them the things to come, as the promiſe was, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.13. What further ſufficiencie would theſe Hereticks require? They might ſay, the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were ignorant of many things after the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> was come upon them: for Peter accounted the <hi>Gentiles</hi> uncleane, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſwere.</hi> But they were not ignorant of any thing that was needfull for the Church to know, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Actes</hi> 20.27. <hi>That he had declared unto them all the Counſell of God: ſo according to the diſpenſation of the times which God had appointed, the Gentiles were taken into the fellowſhip of the Faith.</hi> For though they
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:107656:176"/>were commanded to preach repentance and forgiveneſſe of ſinnes to all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet the preaching muſt begin at <hi>Ieruſalem, Luk.</hi> 24.47. from <hi>Eſa.</hi> 2.3. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they preached not to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> till the time was come, and then <hi>Philip</hi> was ſent to preach to the <hi>Eunuch, Actes</hi> 8.26. and 29. and <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Cornelius, Actes</hi> 10. and <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> euery where, but with this condition, firſt to offer the word of reconciliation to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and after to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> becauſe the Children muſt firſt be fed. <hi>See Marke</hi> 7.27. and <hi>Actes</hi> 13.46. So concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the declaration of things to come, <hi>Agabus</hi> foretold the famine, <hi>Actes</hi> 11.28. that the Church in time might provide for due reliefe: So the prophecyes of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. and 1. <hi>Tim. Chap.</hi> 4. of <hi>Peter.</hi> 2. <hi>Epiſtle Chap.</hi> 2. and 3. and <hi>Iohn: Rev. all,</hi> are no leſſe lights for the knowledge of the true Doctrine, and Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in theſe dayes, than the prophecyes of old were for the knowledge of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when He ſhould come, and the benefits which the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſhould receive by Him, unto the Church which was before His manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the fleſh. And if the Providence of God bee upon all His creatures, His ſpeciall mercy and compaſsion upon His choſen; ſo that Hee never leaues them deſtitute of that which He knowes to be fit for them: can any but <hi>Pepuzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and ſuch franticks thinke, that God will bee careleſſe of His Church, for whoſe ſake He gave His onely Sonne to die? Or can any man be ſuch an Infidell, as to thinke that the inſtruction of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> who is God bleſſed above all, is not ſufficient to guide the Church according to the rule of trueth, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, in the right way to everlaſting life? Therefore follow that rule, and pray for that guide, and let the follies of theſe <hi>Enthouſiaſts</hi> for ever vaniſh.</p>

It was a wonderfull grace and favour, beyond all other men, unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> that whenſoever he went into the Tabernacle, he might talke with God, face to face, as a man converſes with his friend: Is not the ſame grace vouchſafed to us, who not onely in the Churches, but even in our private chambers, or in the open fields, may talke with God, and receive His anſwere in His word? And leſt any man may pretend ignorance, or want of skill, how to preſent himſelfe unto God, all manner of formes of thankes, of of praiſe, of prayers, are ſet out in the Scripture, and all ſumm'd up in that forme which our Lord hath taught us. And that we may
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:107656:177"/>come boldly unto the Throne of Grace, and be aſſured to find helpe in the time of need, we ſhall in His Word not onely receive His owne Anſwer, but likewiſe ſee by examples, how holy and devout men have ſped in the like caſes. Thus we may ſpeake to God, and heare His ſpeech to us, in all places, at all times, either alone or with others; the holy Angels joyning in our converſation, and our ſelves never deſtitute of the fruit thereof.</p>
                        <p>And becauſe the holy Scriptures are the foundation of all our faith, therefore it muſt firſt appeare, That theſe Scriptures are the very Word of God Himſelfe. §. 1.

                        <p>§. 1. <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>1</label> Concerning the firſt, it is an irrefragable argument, that the Scriptures were given of God, becauſe the Prophecies in them which were before-hand concerning things to come, were ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect declarations of them, as that they may rather ſeeme to be Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories then Prophecies. Take for inſtance that promiſe to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> that his ſeed ſhould poſſeſſe <hi>Canaan</hi> after 430. yeeres, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly in the ſelfe ſame day, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.40, 41. were they brought out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> Or the promiſe of <hi>Iudahs</hi> Kingdome foretold by <hi>Iacob, Gen.</hi> 49.8, 9, 10. Of <hi>Ioſia,</hi> and <hi>Cyrus,</hi> prophecied by name, the one above 300. yeeres, the other above 100. yeeres before he was borne: Of the captivity of that nation, and deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> foretold by <hi>Daniel.</hi> For ſeeing God alone is infinite in His wiſedome, and that all His workes are foreknowne to Him alone, therefore can He alone declare from the beginning what ſhall come to paſſe at the laſt, as He ſaith of Himſelfe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.9. whereas the Angels being finite both in their wiſedome and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge know nothing of things to come, but either by ſpeciall reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, as <hi>Gabriel</hi> foretold the birth of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> or by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of the Scripture, or by obſervation of naturall cauſes in their long and ſubtile experiences. And therefore it came to paſſe that all the devils that mocked the heathen by their Oracles, were ſo uncertaine in their anſweres, except they were informed by ſome of the meanes ſpoken of: As the devil gave a certaine anſwere to <hi>Alexander,</hi> concerning his expedition againſt <hi>Darius,</hi> becauſe he knew what the Decree of God was, by the Prophecie of <hi>Daniel, Chap.</hi> 8.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Another Argument that the Scriptures were given by the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> is that admirable conſent of all the Doctrines contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therein, which are delivered with that certaintie of Truth and Knowledge, with that authority and power over the ſoule of the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:107656:177"/>faithfull Reader, and that in ſo ſimple and plaine a manner of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as no other: whereas in mens writings, the unſetledneſſe of their judgement, their ignorance, and doubtfull ſuppoſitions, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when they ſpeake of their owne (as ſeldome they doe) ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies the holy Text, <hi>Rome.</hi> 1.22. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing to teach, they ſhew their folly.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Moreover, the Argument, or things contained in the holy Scriptures, doth manifeſt the Author thereof, the Writers for the moſt part ſhewing their Commiſſion, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord:</hi> and, <hi>Paul an Apoſtle, not by man, but by Ieſus Chriſt, and God the Father:</hi> Then the purport, or intent of the Commiſſion, <hi>We are Ambaſſadors for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Christs ſtead to be reconciled unto God;</hi> And this under ſuch conditions, as none but God alone is able to performe: of acceptance, eternall life; or refuſall, eternall fire.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The glorious and mighty workes which Almighty God gave, eſpecially to the firſt Writers of the Law and of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to doe, and thoſe miracles whereby He continually juſtified the trueth thereof, the wonderous preſervation and deliverances of the profeſſors, as of <hi>Daniel,</hi> &amp;c. And the balefull confuſion of the adverſaries of the Trueth, contained in the Scriptures in all ages, approve that God alone is the Author thereof.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. The hatred of the devil, and his continuall endeavours, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther utterly to deface the Bookes of the holy Scripture, or upon pretext of obſcurity and danger of Hereſie, not to reade them. And againe, the providence of God, in preſerving thoſe Bookes, and the love and delight which He hath begotten in the hearts of His Saints to reade and underſtand them, are no leſſe proofe, that theſe holy Scriptures are the Word of God, and the Teſtimony of His eternall Truth.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. The extraordinary calling of many of the Pen-men of the holy Bookes, and the enabling of them, being ſimple and unlet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered men, to write and to preach thoſe high Myſteries, which none of the Princes of this world did underſtand; as of <hi>Amos</hi> among the Herdmen, of <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the other of the twelve Apoſtles; ſhew that the Author of that Truth and their Bookes was God alone.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. The great 1. Antiquity of the Bookes of the Law pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ſo long uncorrupted: for in compariſon of <hi>Moſes,</hi> almoſt all the writings of the heathen, all their religions, and many of their Gods, are but upſtarts, and things of yeſterday. 2. The great ſimplieity and ſincerity of the Writers, who ſought not their own praiſe, nor concealed their owne faults and imperfections. 3. The conſent of the Church, which receiued the Scriptures, as the word of God. 4. The conſent of forraine Hiſtories, writing of the ſame things with ſuch uncertaintie and untruth, as time and heare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay uſe to bring into Hiſtory; as of <hi>Beroſus, Herodotus, Strabo, Trogus,</hi>
                           <pb n="128" facs="tcp:107656:178"/>and others, are a manifeſt proofe that the true records of the ſame things are the writings which God Himſelfe did dictate to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets which followed after him. For none but God did truely know the creation of the world, and none among men did certainely record the univerſall flood, the Tower of <hi>Babel,</hi> the actes of <hi>Abraham, Iacob, Ioſeph, Moſes, Ioſhua,</hi> and others: So that if the devill might vaunt as he did,</p>

                           <l>I did indite, and <hi>Homer</hi> did write.</l>
                        </q>
                        <p>In the perfection of truth might the Holy Spirit of God ſay as it is recorded, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>All Scripture is given by the inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God:</hi> And, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Prophecie came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the</hi> Holy-Ghoſt.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. And if wee beleeve that the writings of Hiſtorians, and Poets, and other profane Authors, are indeed theirs under whoſe names they goe: ſhall wee not much rather beleeve that they are the writings of God Himſelfe, that goe under His Name? eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſeeing wee know that Hee is a jealous God, and neither would ſuffer His authority to bee abuſed to falſhood, neither would Hee give His Church to bee ever ſeduced by lyars and falſe prophets.</p>
                        <p>§. 2. <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> And theſe holy Oracles, God of His Goodneſſe and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, would have to bee written; from whence, by their excellencie, above all other, they are called Scriptures, or Writings.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Firſt, that wee through patience and comfort of theſe Scriptures, might have firme and ſure hope in God and His pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Secondly, that nothing through mans infirmity might be forgotten, of all that which ought to be in continuall remembrance.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Leſt by the wickedneſſe of men, and the ſubtilty of the devil inciting them thereto, the holy Doctrine of God might be corrupted from the native and true meaning: and ſo new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and new Religions brought in, in ſtead of that Service which we owe onely to God, and that according to His owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Will and Word.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. No man knoweth the thoughts of a man, but onely that ſpirit of a man which is within him: much leſſe can any know the things of God, but onely the holy Spirit of God. The things of God, of which I ſpeake, are either ſuch as concerne Himſelfe; or us: Himſelfe; as that in His being, He is a Spirit Eternall, infinite in Wiſedome, &amp;c. In eſſence one; in Perſons three; in His diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation towards us, that in the fulneſſe of time the Eternall Sonne ſhould dwell in the Tabernacle of our fleſh; that in our nature, and for us, he might make ſatisfaction for our ſinne, that we might be reſtored againe to the favour of God, which wee had loſt by our
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:107656:178"/>tranſgreſſion, and ſo have hope of the full enjoying of thoſe bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits which come unto us thereby, as the reſurrection of our bodies, and eternall life both in body and ſoule. And becauſe it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for us to underſtand thoſe things, except God Himſelfe had revealed them unto us, therfore it was neceſſary that He ſhould vouchſafe the certaine and immutable knowledge of them by His Holy Word.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. No Kingdome can bee ordered according to Iuſtice, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Lawes are not manifeſt, and to bee knowne of every ſubject that will know them. But <hi>Christ</hi> is that King that is to raigne in iuſtice, <hi>Eſay</hi> 32.1. Therefore it was neceſſary that the lawes and ordinances of His Kingdome, which peculiarly is His Church, ſhould be ſo publiſhed, that every one, both ſmall and great might take knowledge of them.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. No puniſhment is due but for ſome offence, and where no law is, there is no tranſgreſsion. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.15. So no reward is due, but either in juſtice for ſome merit above dutie, as the merit of <hi>Christ</hi> on our behalfe: or elſe in mercie by promiſe, for the carefull performance of that which is due. But neither duty, nor puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor merit, nor mercie, can either appeare, or be ſuch where no law is. Therefore it was neceſſary that God by His Word ſhould both ſhew what duty He did require of us, and what puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was due to the breakers of His law, and what reward was due to the obſervers, as the law declares. And moreover, becauſe no man in this ſtate of corruption by originall ſinne, is able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the law of God as he ought, in perfect righteouſneſſe, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was alſo neceſſary in this impoſſibilitie on our parts, to make it knowne how wee might bee delivered from the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by the mediation of another, as the Goſpel ſhewes.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. And becauſe ſo great a benefit as the deliverance of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind from the thraldome of the devill, was never to bee forgotten: therefore it was neceſſary, not onely that the Church ſhould bee prepared unto the expectation thereof; and dayly put in mind by ſuch lively ſignes as the ſacrifices were, the true meaning of which they were taught by the Prophets: but alſo when the time came that the promiſes ſhould bee fulfilled, that the Church ſhould be throughly informed and confirmed in the trueth thereof, by the powerfull doctrine, and glorious miracles which were done both by the authour and finiſher of our faith; and by thoſe who were eye-witreſſes of all things which they teſtified to the world. Therefore it was neceſſary, that both before the comming of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Church ſhould be catechiſed unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by the doctrine of the Law, and the Prophets; and after His comming bee fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> evermore working in the hearts of the elect, that the things which were taught, ſhould be beleeved.</p>
                        <p>§. 3. Hath it indeede beene the practiſe of the devill by his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:107656:179"/>agents the perſecuters of the Church, to deface the Holy Scripture, and to put out their remembrance among men? Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries affirme it. Neither can the Father of lies hate any thing ſo much as the trueth: nor the enemie of man-kind, endeavour any thing ſo earneſtly, as to defact that, by the knowledge whereof man may find the way to eternall life: yet great was the trueth, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed. Then by hereticks he would corrupt it; but yet the trueth prevailed. Then hee would keepe it from us in an unknowne tongue; but yet the trueth appeared, and every man may reade in his owne tongue the wonderfull workes of God, <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> and the reſt: yet the devill had one tricke more in his budget; that ſeeing hee could neither deface, nor corrupt, nor conceale the bookes of Holy Scripture in a forraine tongue, whoſe vulgar uſe is vaniſh't among men, he would ſhuffle in other bookes among them, that ſo we might not diſcerne the true Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the falſe. And if any queſtion grew about the Child; traditions which wee muſt receive with equall affection of piety, muſt decide it. Strange Divinitie! Did the Church deale thus of ancient time? For you onely are wiſe, you onely will be the people: Shew the cuſtome of the Church: you claime to Fathers: ſhew it from them. Saint <hi>Athanaſius in Synops.</hi> divides the bookes of the Old-Teſtament (as wee) into Canonicall, and not Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall.

                        <p>Now concerning the bookes of the New-Teſtament, Saint <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom ad Paulin.</hi> reckons them as wee.

But for the full deciſion of this queſtion, let us looke unto the undoubted truth of the Scripture, &amp; by the Scripture it ſelfe, let us learne what is Scripture, or the word of God. 1. Therfore concerning the books of the New-Teſtament, <hi>M.

                           <hi>mimmakom acher,</hi> in <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 14. is for ſenſe in that place, equivalent to any of the names of God, which the prophet did there forbeare to remember, becauſe hee would not that any of the names of God ſhould bee propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned among the heathen, with whom he lived: So alſo <hi>Luther</hi> held, the <hi>Revelation</hi> to be the writing of ſome well-meaning honeſt man, but not Canonical. Wherein I thinke the wonderfull wiſdome and mercy of God appeared; to hide the meaning of that booke from him, leſt he ſhould be deſtroyed with pride, when he ſhould ſee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and his miniſtery ſo alluded to therein. But let <hi>Luther</hi> and his followers in this queſtion thinke by themſelues: betweene us and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> there is no difference, both parties holding all the bookes of the New-Teſtament to be canonical. The onely doubt is about the books which we call Apocryphal, of unknowne and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Authors, or ſtrange doctrines delivered therein. In which que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, the Canon or rule of the New-Teſtament is for us. For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning all the books of the Old-Teſtament, the reaſon ſtands thus.</p>
                        <pb n="132" facs="tcp:107656:180"/>
                        <p n="1">1. All the oracles of God or Canonicall Scripture, was received in the Church of the <hi>Iewes.</hi> But none of the Apocryphall bookes were received in the Church of the <hi>Iewes.</hi> Therefore none of the Apocryphall bookes are the Oracles of God. The propoſition is Saint <hi>Pauls,</hi> and he accounts it (as well hee may) the firſt and chiefe preeminence of the <hi>Iew,</hi> that unto them the Oracles of God were committed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.2. The aſſumption is manifeſt: for the Apocryphall bookes were extant onely in <hi>Greeke,</hi> which language the <hi>Iewes</hi> never uſed in their holy ſeruices. And although the booke of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> were begun by the grand father in <hi>Hebrew;</hi> yet was it augmented and finiſhed in <hi>Greeke</hi> by the grand-child. And although the firſt booke of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> were extant in <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew;</hi> yet was it not therefore Canonicall, no more than the ſecond that was written in <hi>Greeke.</hi> So the concluſion ſtands ſure. And if neither the Church before <hi>Chriſt</hi> received thoſe Apocryphall bookes: nor the ancient church ſince His ſuffering, accounted them Canonicall (for the Authour of the Sophiſticate Cannons of the Apoſtles, wee receive not) upon what ground then ſhould the Fathers of <hi>Trent</hi> preſume to doe that, which neither the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, or Fathers attempted before?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Such another argument you have from <hi>Luke</hi> 24.27. where it is ſaid, that <hi>Christ</hi> beginning at <hi>Moſes,</hi> and all the Prophets, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded unto them all the Scriptures, the things that were written concerning Himſelfe. So all the Scriptures are underſtood by the Law and the Prophets (as I ſhewed before) and yet for further explication, it is added in <hi>verſe</hi> 44. the Law, the Prophets, and the <hi>Pſalmes.</hi> For of all the <hi>Cethubim,</hi> the booke of <hi>Pſalmes</hi> was firſt, and by a <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> is put for all the reſt. Now to which of all theſe will you bring the Apocryphall bookes? By the Law you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the five Bookes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which the <hi>Samaritanes,</hi> and all the ſects of the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Religion, except the hereticks called <hi>Naſacheans,</hi> did receive. The ſects of the <hi>Sadduces</hi> and <hi>Samaritanes</hi> rejected the reſt; but the Church of the <hi>Iewes</hi> held all the Prophets, both former and later, with all the <hi>Kebuthim</hi> to bee holy Scripture, but the Apocrypha are reckoned with none of theſe.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. A third argument from the holy Scripture againſt theſe apocryphals is from <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.10. <hi>The teſtimony of</hi> Ieſus, <hi>is the Spirit of prophecie.</hi> But in theſe apocryphals which the <hi>Iewes</hi> received not, there is no prophecy, no evident teſtimony of <hi>Ieſus</hi> that was to come. Therefore they are no witneſſes of Him, no word of His. And although in the fourth booke of that ſuppoſed <hi>Eſdras,</hi> there be mention of <hi>Ieſus Christ, Chap.</hi> 7.27, 28. yet the falſe narration of things never done, and other fictions, <hi>See Maſter Brerew: Enq. Chap.</hi> 13. have diſcredited thoſe bookes ſo farre, that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves doe not mention them in their new Canon, and vouchſafe them a place in the end of their Bibles onely, leſt they ſhould be loſt. <hi>Object.</hi> But the Fathers themſelves call theſe bookes Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:107656:180"/>
                           <hi>Anſwer.</hi> And our Church yeelds they are ſo, in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Fathers, that is, ſerving for rules of good life and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; but not of faith, as the holy Scriptures; and that is the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betweene us and <hi>Trent.</hi>

                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label> That the holy Scripture is abundantly ſufficient to teach all things that belong to faith and godlineſſe, is manifeſt by the reaſons brought for the proofe of the ſecond queſtion. That it was neceſſary for us, that God, by His written Word, ſhould vouchſafe unto us, the knowledge of His will. 1. For how could either our hope and comfort in God be firme and ſure, if they were not groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon His holy promiſes that never faile? 2. And if no man know the things of God, but onely the Spirit of God; how could we beleeve that which is to be beleeved of Him, or hoped for, our ſelues? as the Trinity of Perſons, the Incarnation of the Son, the reſurrection of the body, &amp;c. but by the inſtruction of His holy Word? 3. How could we have the true knowledge of ſinne, and the puniſhment thereof, but by His Law; whereby He hath taught us what duty we owe to Him, to our neighbour, and to our ſelues? And if the holy Scripture doth thorowly inſtruct us in all things that we ought to doe or to beleeve, is not the ſufficiency and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection thereof able to teach us how to be perfect in every good worke? <hi>See</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16, 17.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And if it might with due reverence unto God be ſuppoſed, that the holy Scriptures have not ſufficiently inſtructed us in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing; Yet who is he, or what is that Church that may preſume to adde to His word? <hi>Proverb.</hi> 30.6. Leſt if they teach things that are not to be beleeved, or command that which is not to be done, our faith be found to be fooliſhneſſe, and our obedience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, if not ſinne, yet without reward, as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Eſay</hi> 1.12. <hi>Who hath required this at your hand?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. As the man is, ſo is his ſtrength, <hi>Iud:</hi> 8.21. as his wiſedome is, ſuch are his words. And ſeeing it is evident by the Scripture which is given, that it was the good will and pleaſure of Almighty God, to give inſtructions unto His Church; and that it hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been prooved, that the Wiſedome, <hi>Chapter</hi> 5. and the Trueth of God, as all His others dignities, are infinite, <hi>Chapter</hi> 7. if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and directions of the Scriptures were not in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect perfect and ſufficient for the Church, to that end for which they were written; then the Wiſedome of Goodnes of God ſhould be defective in that which was neceſſary for His Church to know. But that is impoſſible. Therefore the Holy Scripture is ſufficient.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. If God have not ſufficiently and perfectly inſtructed us by His word what we ought to doe, and to beleeve; then can He not in Iuſtice puniſh thoſe defects which ſhall be found in our Faith or obedience, eſpecially ſeeing we are not bound by any precept in His revealed will, to hearken to any traditions with that reverence as to His word, but rather are every where commanded to hearken
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:107656:181"/>to His word, and that without any adding thereto or taking away therefrom, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.1, 2. and 5.32. <hi>Eſay</hi> 8.20. ſends us to the Law and to the Teſtimony; and if any one ſhall ſpeake not according to this Word, it is becauſe there is no light in them. So our Lord ſends us to the Scriptures, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.39. Therefore the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are perfect and ſufficient to teach all things that belong by way of divine revelation, to faith and godlineſſe.

Firſt from the neceſſity of Traditions: Secondly, for that it is ſuppoſed that ſome bookes of the holy Writ are loſt. For the firſt, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, even by the reaſons that are brought for the ſufficiency of the Scripture. For if it were alwayes neceſſary, that the ſervice of God in His Church ſhould be according to His owne commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and direction; it muſt follow neceſſarily, either that the Scriptures ſhould have beene given even from the beginning of the world (for the Church of the redeemed began in <hi>Adam</hi>) or elſe that the ſeruice of the Church, was onely according to tradition. The firſt is apparently falſe. For <hi>Moſes</hi> was the firſt inditer of any Scripture, and that after the deliverance out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> which was after the Creation of the world 2513 yeeres. Therefore the ſecond followes of neceſſity, that Traditions were neceſſary.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſwer.</hi> This is a wilfull miſtaking of the queſtion, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the ſufficiency of the Scriptures, muſt needs be limited to the times ſince the Scripture was given. But <hi>Moſes</hi> was not the firſt inditer of the holy Scripture; but God Himſelfe, who had firſt written His Law in mans heart, did ſecondly write it in two Tables of ſtone, with His owne hand, in mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> And thirdly againe when the Tables of the Covenant were broken; this was the firſt of all that which we call holy Scripture. After which time God taught <hi>Moſes</hi> the Originall of the world, the ſinne, and redemption of mankind, the order of times, and whatſoever was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for that people to know, and to doe. And although it bee moſt true, that the faith and ſeruices of the Church before the law, was onely according to tradition; yet becauſe thoſe traditions were not kept as God had taught them, God brought upon the world of the ungodly, the Flood. Yet even within foure hundred yeeres after the Flood, by the craft of the devill, and his new revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the beſt among men became Idolaters, as it is manifeſt in

In the third place, Traditions may ſignifie any rule thruſt upon the Church, as neceſſary to be beleeved or obſerued quite beſides, or contrary to the word of God, for conſcience ſake toward God; that Prieſts and Nunnes may not marry: which things, though they be brought in as Apoſtolicall, or Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Traditions, yet by the rule of Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3. they ſeeme rather to leane to the doctrines of devills, beleeved by ſuch as ſpeake lyes in hypocrifie, and have their conſciences ſeared.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. For if God, who is prayſed for His trueth, in that Hee hath magnified His Word above all His Name, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 138.2. hath not preſerved His Scripture, intyer from the corruption of man, from the alteration, addition, or taking away that they might make: what comfort or certaine inſtruction can wee have thereby? What aſſurance of hope by thoſe promiſes of which wee are not ſure whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:107656:183"/>they be the promiſes of God, or the imaginations of men? Thus the end for which God of His goodns gave thoſe Scriptures ſhould be fruſtrate; and man in that incertainty nothing furthered toward eternall life. Thus the Church ſhould fayle in the duty and faithfull performance of that truſt which ſhe owes unto God, in preſerving that treaſure which was committed to her charge and ſafe keeping. But theſe things are not to be granted. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Scriptures are come unto us in that integrity or purity in which they were at firſt delivered to the Church: they of the old Teſtament in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue; they of the new in <hi>Greeke.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="2">2. The conſtant conſent of all the doctrines and promiſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Scriptures, the efficacie and power of that Spirit which is manifeſt in the deliverie thereof, are evident proofes, that the Scripture is ſtill in that purity in which God gave it unto the Church. And although God in thoſe Scriptures have vouchſafed to apply Himſelfe to our underſtanding, and as a nurſe, to liſp with her infant; yet ſo much is the fooliſhneſſe of God wiſer than man, and the weakneſſe of God ſtronger than men, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.25. as that it is ſtill manifeſt in the whole body of the holy writ, that nothing of humane droſſe is mixt there-with; but that His Word is ſtill as before, pure as ſilver, that hath beene tryed ſeven times in the fire.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. This fire is that dampiſh ſmother-fire of hereſies, which the devill did kindle among his brands: among whom, though ſome rejected the authority of ſundry bookes of Holy Scripture, as <hi>Marcion</hi> and others: ſome corrupted the ſence thereof by <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories,</hi> and forraine interpretations, as the <hi>Origeniſts, See Auguſtin de Gen. ad literam:</hi> others by wreſting it from the native ſence, to the ſupportance of their owne hereſies: yet the Church which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued faithfull in the doctrine of God, conſtantly with-ſtood all theſe attempts, and ever maintained the ſincerity, as of the doctrine, ſo of the Holy Scripture, on which it was founded. And becauſe the Scripture is either of the old, or of the new Teſtament, it is fit to ſpeake to each of them in particular.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. And firſt, concerning the old Teſtament, it is manifeſt that the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whoſe hope was ſet on that <hi>Meſsiah</hi> that was to come, had no cauſe to corrupt the text of the holy writ; but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the promiſes which they had in the Law, and in the Prophets, the expoſitors thereof, ſo to hope, that He ſhould be ſuch a deliverer and Saviour, as was promiſed, by which hope they were bound to preſerue the Scripture in all integrity, that they might ſee the full accompliſhment thereof when He was come.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Beſide the Prieſts, whoſe lips ſhould preſerue knowledge, and at whoſe mouth they ſhould ſeeke the Law, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.7. there was from <hi>Samuel</hi> unto the dayes of <hi>Ezra,</hi> a perpetuall ſucceſſion of Prophets, who could not in any wayes have endured ſo great a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption uncontrouled, as that the Word of the Lord ſhould be
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:107656:184"/>changed or depraved. And although the Scriptures before the time of <hi>Ezra</hi> had beene corrupted, yet he being a Prophet, a Prieſt, and a perfect ſcribe of the Law of the Lord, and of the Statutes of <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el;</hi> that had prepared his heart to teach the Law of God, and His ſtatutes and judgements, <hi>Ezra</hi> 7. who changed the forme of their <hi>Chaldean,</hi> or <hi>Samaritane</hi> letters, for thoſe which are now in uſe: hee (I ſay) would have taken away all ſuch corruptions or changes, as had come to the Holy Scripture, if it might bee imagined that any could come in the time of the Prophets that were before; as far as the diverſitie of Copies gave them light.</p>

They touch it not but with waſhed hands; neither doe they take the rolle by the midſt, but by the margent, and that onely with the right hand, for which they bring <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.2. <hi>At His right hand was a fiery Law.</hi> No man may lay it on His knees, nor leane upon it when he reads, nor read it as other writings, &amp;c. leſt the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bookes grow into contempt; no man may ſit upon the fourme or bed on which it lyes, nor lay it towards the beds feet, nor lay other bookes upon it; and their reaſon, for that the whole Law is holy, and that every letter therein, containes infinite wiſdome; and that God hath more care of the Letters and Syllables of the Law, then of the ſtarres of heaven. And that this care was not onely of the bookes of the Law, but likewiſe of all the holy Scripture of the old Teſtament indifferently; you may know by that infinite diligence of the <hi>Masôrites,</hi> who to the intent, that the purity of all the holy Text might be preſerued intier, numbred in the whole Bible, the Verſes, the Words, the Letters; and of them, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and the finall; and what verſe, what word, and letter, was the midſt of every booke: and among the Letters, they noted how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times every one was found in every booke; if any one were big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or leſſe then the due proportion, or higher then the reſt; or pointed extraordinarily: what <hi>holem</hi> was with <hi>vau,</hi> and what with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; what <hi>hirick</hi> was written with <hi>jod,</hi> and what not; what ſpace was more, what leſſe, betweene the paragraphs: when two words were to be read as one; when one as two: when the letters in the midſt of a word ſhould be tranſpoſed, and that which was in the end of one word, to be put to the beginning of another, with many ſuch obſeruations which you may read in <hi>Shickard</hi> cited before <hi>De Masôreth pag.</hi> 45. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that no corruption or alteration could come into the text of the old Teſtament, but by theſe rules of the <hi>Masôreth</hi> it might be eaſily detected. Neither is this <hi>Masôreth</hi> wonderfull onely, for the infinite diligence and paines that was uſed in the compiling thereof, but alſo venerable for the Authors, which by the authorities of the Hebrewes, were <hi>Ezra,</hi> and the Prophets of his time, which were called the men of the great Synagogue, or more truely, the great men of the Synagogue, <hi>Haggai, Zachary, Malachy, Daniel, Hananiah, Miſheel, Azariah, Nehemiah, Mardoche, Zorobabel,</hi> and of the moſt wiſe and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned among the reſt, to the number of 120. For this could not be the worke of one man, or of one age. And although the ſucceſſion of the Synagogue ſtill continued, in ſome ſort; yet by reaſon of the many warres and troubles, after their returne from <hi>Babylon,</hi> even untill the laſt ruine of their nation by <hi>Adrian,</hi> about the yeere after the death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> one hundred, this worke was often at a ſtand, and not fully finiſhed, till about the yeere five hundred and tenne, after the Incarnation. Whereupon, thoſe <hi>Masôrites</hi>
                              <pb n="142" facs="tcp:107656:185"/>are by ſome, unduely thought to bee the firſt Authors of that worke.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. Alſo the whole Art of the <hi>Kabalists,</hi> in high eſteeme among the Hebrewes, above all others; without this purity of the holy Text, were either nothing worth, or rather in it ſelfe, nothing at all. But the argument from hence, to proove the purity of the Scripture, among the common ſort, for whom I write, would not be eaſie to be underſtood. Therefore I referre them that are deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to know further hereof, to the author forenamed, <hi>pag.</hi> 60. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to <hi>Iohn Reuchlin,</hi> and others that have written of that Art. For by this which I have already ſaid, I thinke it is cleare, to him that is not wilfully blind, how farre it was from the Church of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> to offer any ſacriledge to the Booke of God; who with ſuch infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite paines and care, have wall'd in that holy ground, leſt beaſts ſhould breake into it.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. 1. And for further proofe, that the Hebrewes were the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Library keepers of that booke, as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> calls them; you may take the teſtimony of Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. where hee calls the Church, the pillar and ſtay of Faith: not that in an impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite and ignorant faith, we ſhould hold it ſufficient to beleeve as the Church beleeves; but becauſe the Church had evermore, true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and faithfully, preſerued and followed the trueth of God, revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in His Word, as it had received it from Him at the firſt. And if this be true of the Church in generall, it muſt needs be moſt true of that moſt ancient and publike Church, firſt choſen from all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by whom the Name of the Lord ſhould be called upon, from whom the word of the Lord was to proceed to other nations, <hi>Eſay</hi> 2.3. whereas the Church of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> was then ſo lately called, as that it could give no proofe of it ſelfe, to be worthy of ſuch ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable titles. 2. Moreover, in the ſecond Epiſtle to <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. he ſaith, That the Scriptures are able to make a man wiſe unto ſaluation, through the faith which is in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> But how ſhall we be aſſured of this, if we be not firſt perſwaded, that they are free from corruption? 3. And why ſhould our Lord ſend us to ſearch the Scriptures, which were then onely the Old Teſtament, there to find eternall life, if in ſtead of the trueth of God, we ſhould there find the falſhood of men? <hi>See Luke</hi> 16.29, 31. and <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.39. 4. And that which is above all proofe, is, that teſtimony which our Lord Himſelfe gave to the teachers of that people, who are accuſed of ſuch treaſon againſt God. For He reprooving their faults, and ſhewing how the Law did bind the thoughts and intents of the heart, as you may read <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>Lu.</hi> 6.27. and elſewhere: yet doth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther He, nor any of His Apoſtles, at any time, lay this ſinne to their charge, that they had corrupted the Word of God, otherwayes then by their traditions, or by their peruerſe interpretation thereof: but rather commands His hearers, to follow that which they taught ſitting in the Chaire of <hi>Moſes;</hi> that is, teaching according to the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:107656:185"/>Law as <hi>Moſes</hi> delivered it: which they could not doe, if it were corrupted from that purity which it had at the firſt. And they that are acquitted by ſuch a Iudge ought certainely to be held free, by all them that reverence His judgement. 5. Now among theſe were many who did beleeve, beſides many thouſands of other <hi>Iewes</hi> which were obedient to the faith, as it is manifeſt <hi>Act.</hi> 6.7. and 21.20.

Moreover the moſt ancient tranſlators, even from the 70. which were almoſt 300. yeeres before <hi>Chriſt</hi> (if that which is now extant be any rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of it) and that <hi>Chaldee</hi> of <hi>Ionathan,</hi> who is ſaid to have beene the diſciple of <hi>Hillel,</hi> which lived, as ſome write, 100. yeeres before <hi>Christ,</hi> and all that have followed after theſe, have tranſlated ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time after the margent; ſomtime after the line, &amp; often-times have noted both, as you may ſee in many inſtances in the place cited.</p>
                           <p>And that which is above all, the Pen-men of the new Teſtament uſe in ſome places, the word of the margent for that in the line. So that <hi>Galatinus</hi> with his late <hi>Rabbins,</hi> may ſtill ſleepe upon the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of their owne dreame. For nothing of the <hi>Talmud</hi> was gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together till about the yeere of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> 150. when one Rabbi <hi>Iudas</hi> compiled into one volume, the expoſitions on the law and the Prophets, which other Doctors had written, ſome before, ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Christ,</hi> which Booke hee called <hi>Miſhna,</hi> a copie, or ſecond rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and divided it into <hi>Six Sedarim</hi> or orders. Some 200. yeeres or more after him, Rabbi <hi>Iohanan,</hi> or <hi>Iohn,</hi> gathered the <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud,</hi> or Doctrinall of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> out of the writings of ſuch Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins, as wrote after the other: and this <hi>Talmud</hi> is but a commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:107656:187"/>on the former <hi>Miſhna.</hi> After him likewiſe, about the yeere of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> 500. Rabbi <hi>Aſſe</hi> made a further collection of the <hi>Babylonian Talmud;</hi> of ſpeciall uſe among the <hi>Iewes.</hi> Both theſe <hi>Talmuds</hi> are full of fables and idle fictions, to the depravation of the trueth of God: But about the yeere, 1200. Rabbi <hi>Moſes ben Maimon,</hi> thence called <hi>Ra M Ba M,</hi> and <hi>Maimoni,</hi> gathered out that which was good, and any way availeable for underſtanding the rites and ceremonies of the Law, and left out thoſe fooleries of which the <hi>Talmuds</hi> were full, and therefore <hi>Poſtellus</hi> ſaid rightly of him, that hee is <hi>Instar omnium.</hi> For further knowledge of which things, you may read <hi>Galatinus, H. Ainſworth, Shickard, P. Ricius,</hi> and others. Now if neither the <hi>Talmud,</hi> nor the <hi>Miſhna</hi> were extant of ſo long time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Chriſt,</hi> how could the writings there cited, being in private hands, bring in any publike corruption into the text of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which long time before that, had beene delivered ſafe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire into the hands of the Church of the <hi>Gentiles?</hi> But although it be yeelded unto, that either the <hi>Masôrites,</hi> or the <hi>Talmudiſts,</hi> or the <hi>Cabaliſts</hi> by any private notes of theirs, or their expoſitions, have corrupted either the text, or native meaning thereof; yet doth it not therefore follow that the Nation of the <hi>Iewes</hi> have accepted theſe corruptions, much leſſe that they hold them of divine autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, as they doe the marginall <hi>Keries;</hi> and yet much leſſe can it be made to appeare, that the Tranſlators of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have at any time accepted of any ſuch notes, no more then we heretofore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the notes on the <hi>Geneva</hi> Bibles to bee Canonicall Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                           <p>But you will aske, when thoſe <hi>Keries,</hi> or marginall readings (for they are alwayes read for the <hi>Cethib,</hi> or word written in the text) came to the Holy Scripture?</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſwere.</hi> The moſt voyces are for <hi>Ezra,</hi> that he having care of the Eccleſiaſticall policie, and eſpecially of the integritie of the Holy Scripture, in conferring the copies, and the differences among them, noted ſuch as hee thought fitteſt: and that the Copies might not differ any more, began that <hi>Masôreth,</hi> of which I ſpake. But <hi>Galatinus, Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 8. ſaith, that this is a lewd lie of the later <hi>Iewes;</hi> for then they ſhould not have beene called corrections of the <hi>Scribes,</hi> but of <hi>Ezra;</hi> yet hee confeſſeth that they were long before the time of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſeeing <hi>Ionathan</hi> the Author of the <hi>Chaldean</hi> tranſlation, doth often-times tranſlate, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the margine; yet will he not have <hi>Ezra</hi> the Author of them, for then he durſt not (I thinke) ſo ſaucily refuſe them, or for them the <hi>Cethib,</hi> as errours and corruptions of the text, as hee doth. But <hi>Shikkard,</hi> as he cites the common conſent of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> puts it conſtantly upon <hi>Ezra.</hi> That with much care and diligence he got divers copies of the Scripture, compared them with thoſe that were authenticall, and noted them as you heard.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. But if there were any copies that were authenticall, what nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:107656:187"/>this ſuperfluous diligence? 2. Beſide, what could 70. yeeres of the captivitie doe to corrupt ſo many copies, when they had in the captivitie ſo many Prophets? As <hi>Daniel, Ezechiel, Ezra;</hi> beſide ſo many worthies as you read of in <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Ezra:</hi> and <hi>Ieremiah</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them that were left at home? Eſpecially ſeeing a copie may continue many ſeuenty of yeeres, as you read in <hi>Rambam</hi> of one of 700. yeres, in his time, and <hi>Cunaeus</hi> cites the <hi>Chronicle</hi> called <hi>Iucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin,</hi> concerning a Bible written by <hi>Hillel,</hi> betweene whoſe times were 900. yeeres; and yet more, the learned <hi>Patrick Young,</hi> aſſures us of a beautifull Copie of the whole Scripture, written by <hi>Tecla,</hi> in the time of the firſt Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> at this time extant in his Majeſties Library, <hi>Praef. in epist. Clementis ad Curinthios.</hi> 3. And that which is moſt of all, to proove that <hi>Ezra</hi> was no Author of the <hi>Keries,</hi> in the Bookes of the Scripture, written before his time, is this. That as almoſt none of the Scripture written be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; ſo none of the Bookes after the captivitie, except per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps <hi>Malachi,</hi> are without them: Did not <hi>Ezra, Daniel, Zachary, Haggai,</hi> know their owne meaning? Were they not able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe it? Yes. You will ſay then, what needed thoſe <hi>Keries</hi> in their Bookes of the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> and thoſe that beare their owne names, written by themſelues? I ſpeake not this to uphold that fancie of <hi>Galatinus,</hi> that theſe corruptions of the Scripture (as he the admirer of himſelfe, ignorantly termes them) were made by the <hi>Iewes</hi> after <hi>Ezra,</hi> and before the time of our Lord: for could ſuch treaſon be wrought againſt God and His trueth, as to peruert His ſtraight waies, and His words, and would not His Sonne, who ever honoured the Father, and did that which was pleaſing in His ſight, ſo much as reprove it, not once ſay, ſinne no more? Nor doe I ſay it to contradict them who could find no Critick of the books of the Bible before <hi>Ezra:</hi> but to juſtifie the trueth: That the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets by the revelation of that Spirit by which they wrote, were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of them the authors of thoſe <hi>Keries</hi> or notes in their owne bookes, as the Doctors, <hi>in Talmud Babeli in Nedarim,</hi> or treaties of vowes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>fol.</hi> 37. <hi>b.</hi> affirme. The word read, and not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, (that is the <hi>Keries</hi> which are read from the margine, and not written in the text) <hi>and written and not read,</hi> are the tradition of <hi>Moſes</hi> from mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and they explaine it ſo: <hi>Moſes</hi> received in <hi>Sinai,</hi> and ſo delivered it to <hi>Iſrael.</hi> An example or two by the way will guide us well. It is ſaid, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. <hi>That the Law was ordained by Angels: as miniſtring Spirits (by the divine appointment) to Moſes the Mediator of the old Covenant.</hi> He received it by voice, and although the eare doth judge of words, as the mouth doth taſte the meate; yet where the meaning of the words was doubtfull, there is was neceſſary for him ſo to write, as in <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.8. the word <gap reason="foreign">

Then concerning that which ſome others bring, for the vulgar edition of the Latine to be authenticall: if upon better view, they will be content, where it is faulty or doubtfull, to examine and correct it by the Greeke copy, we ſhall not need to ſpend any time about it. So the onely oppoſition is from <hi>Mahumed,</hi> who although he ſpeakes more then can be look't for from an aduerſary, concerning <hi>Christ,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends His diſciples, and other penne-men of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as men, Holy, True, and Faithfull followers of their Maſter: yet he ſaith, that the Chriſtians which were after them, corrupted their writings. And that it may appeare what ſpirit ſet this mutinous ſouldier a worke, he denies that which is the ground and foundation of our redemption, ſaying, That <hi>Christ</hi> was neither the Sonne of God, nor yet that He was crucified for us. <hi>See Cusa Cribr. Alchoran lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. I have already prooved, that our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator muſt be God, <hi>Chap.</hi> 21.

And if the reaſons there delivered, be of force to proove the concluſions, then doe they ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute this falſhood of <hi>Mahumed:</hi> and if this Forger had wit to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, we ſay no other thing of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when according to the Scriptures we call Him the Sonne of God, then <hi>Mahumed</hi> himſelfe ſaith, when according to the ſelfe ſame Scriptures, he calls Him the <hi>word of God:</hi> For though <hi>Sonne</hi> in the Scripture, be of large ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; As ſonnes of the quiver, for arrowes, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.13.

So in that which the mind or underſtanding of man doth view, the name thereof, the word, the <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

But it cannot be true which <hi>Mahumed</hi> ſaith, concerning the writings of the Apoſtles, that they are corrupted. For (as in all other) ſo in the particulars, the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments doe both agree; and it hath been prooved before, that the bookes of the Old Teſtament doe ſtill remaine in their integrity. 2. Neither can the trueth in theſe two points, concerning <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which had been profeſſed 600 yeeres almoſt, before <hi>Mahumed</hi> was borne; which ſo many Chriſtians, in all their perſecutions, had ſo conſtantly ſealed unto, with ſo many thouſands of their bloods, ſhed in every corner of the world, be defaced by a new deviſed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery of <hi>Mahumed.</hi> 3. Moreover, what can be more abſurd, and witleſſe, then to ſay, or thinke, that the Chriſtians would falſify the Scriptures in theſe two points, for which above all other things their Religion was hated by the Infidels, and themſelues ſo deadly perſecuted, becauſe they held Him to be God, that had died as a man? and affirmed that He had riſen againe, whom they confeſſed to have died on the Croſſe?</p>
                           <p>Neither doth he accuſe the Chriſtians in theſe two things only, but alſo that they had defaced his name and memory out of that promiſe which our Lord made to His diſciples concerning the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt.</hi> For <hi>Mahumed</hi> would be he by whom they ſhould be led into all trueth. <hi>Marſ. Fic. de Chriſt. Rel. cap.</hi> 36. and out of him, <hi>Hugo Grocius de Rel: Chriſt. lib.</hi> 6. But <hi>Mahound,</hi> you never decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what things ſhould come, as the promiſe of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> doth ſtand; For as you diſclaime miracles, ſo where you ſpeake beſide the text of the Scripture, you utter onely your owne errours. 2. Moreover this promiſe was made to the Apoſtles, and to bee fulfilled in them, eſpecially by whoſe miniſtery the word was to proceed from <hi>Sion</hi> among the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> which was never promiſed to be preached by <hi>Mahumed,</hi> or his theeues of <hi>Arabia.</hi> 3. Beſide that glorious gift of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> the manifeſtation whereof, by ſpeaking with tongues, and working miracles, had ceaſed in the Church long before <hi>Mahumed</hi> was borne, inſomuch that <hi>Aug.</hi> 200 yeeres before him, had profeſt that he that would not then beleeve without a miracle, <hi>Magnum ipſe miraculum eſt.</hi> And therefore that
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:107656:189"/>tricke of the whiſpering Dove, the lie of the Camel that ſpake to him in the night; and that piece of the Moone that dropt into his ſleeve; as they came too late, as they were to no end, and without witneſſes; ſo are they againſt his owne profeſſion, that he came not with miracles. 4. And againe, if our Lord had made any ſuch promiſe as might concerne him; the Chriſtians, who ever reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced His word, were bound by that promiſe to reverence the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of <hi>Mahumed,</hi> and to expect what further light or manifeſtation of the trueth hee would bring to the Church. But his doctrine brings in againe thoſe weake and beggerly rudiments of the law; circumciſion, and the difference of meats, directly contrary to <hi>Christ,</hi> and the doctrine of His Apoſtles, who teach the fulfilling, and utter abrogating of all theſe ceremonies by <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And yet in thoſe ceremonies of meats and drinkes, there is ſuch a diſſenſion about Wine, as that his followers cannot agree unto this day. His doctrine of many wives, though tollerated for a time by <hi>Moſes,</hi> in in that hard-hearted people of the <hi>Iewes;</hi> yet is contrary to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Prophets, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.14, 15. &amp; of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and His Apoſtles. By all which things it may appeare, that <hi>Mahumed</hi> ran when he was not ſent: which he himſelfe (if his ſenceleſſe followers could ſee it) doth confeſſe, in that he doth utterly forbid them to queſtion any thing in his <hi>Alchoran,</hi> or to diſpute about his religion, but to follow it in blind obedience. And whether the wares be counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit, which you muſt buy unſeene, every man may judge. And theſe reaſons againſt <hi>Mahumed</hi> in particular, with the reſt that are againſt <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and his competitors, in the Note on <hi>Chap.</hi> 23. § 1. are ſufficient to proove, that our Lord made no ſuch promiſe of <hi>Mahumed</hi> to come, as he did dreame, and therefore that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Apoſtles are not corrupted, either to foreſtall his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, or to deface his memory.</p>
                           <p n="9">9. And yet more particularly, to free the writings of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles from this <hi>Mahumetan</hi> ſlaunder, take that word of God Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, which is in <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.20. <hi>Neither pray I for theſe alone, but for them alſo which ſhall beleeve on me, through their word.</hi> This word of the Apoſtles cannot be underſtood onely of that word which they ſpake unto the people; but much more of all the Scriptures of the New Teſtament, which ſhould be left in writing to the Church; by which, in all ages of the Church, ſince their time, children were to be begotten unto God through a lively faith, by which they ſhould apprehend the ſatisfaction of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſo have an entrance unto God by Him. And ſeeing that in all ages ſince the Apoſtles, we find the effect of our Mediators prayer, that their writings have beene that Word by which the faithfull have beleeved on Him; and ſo hath done, and ſtill doth, that worke for which it was ſent: thereby are we ſure that it is their word, their owne word, as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered it, not corrupted, or ſophiſticate by any device of man, for any purpoſe or intent, as that falſe prophet doth pretend. And
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:107656:190"/>that you may ſee how great the trueth is, and how it prevailes, take out of <hi>Ficinus,</hi> in the ſaid 36. <hi>cap.</hi> what this <hi>Mahumed</hi> confeſſeth of himſelfe: whereby you may ſee, how betweene his arrogance, and his ignorance, the trueth doth ſhew it ſelfe. He confeſſeth that he neither had done any miracle, nor none could doe. That he was pure man, and no more. That he could give no pardon for ſinne: That he would not be call'd upon, or worſhipped. And although in his madneſſe, he pretended himſelfe to be a meſſenger ſent from God, and inſpir'd by Him, and that he was the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt;</hi> yet when his raving fit was off, hee confeſt that hee was ignorant of many things, and that there were ſomethings in his bookes, of the trueth of which there might be doubt, and whoſoever ſhall worſhip one God, and live honeſtly, whether he be <hi>Iew, Chriſtian,</hi> or <hi>Sarazen,</hi> ſhall have mercy from God. What is then the preferment of his <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choran</hi> before the holy Scriptures? or why ſhall wee forſake our moſt holy guide, whom he confeſſeth to be the breath and word of God, and to have the next place unto God in heaven; that we may become circumciſed, and abſtaine from Swines-fleſh and wine, and enjoy fleſhly pleaſure with many wives, if nothing of all this give us any furtherance to eternall life?</p>
                           <p n="10">10. To end this queſtion, I will bring this only argument, which for ſubſtance is indifferent to both the Teſtaments, the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces only differing. If the writings of the holy Scriptures be corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, either thoſe corruptions muſt come in by little and little into the copies of the Scripture, while they were diſperſed by writing: or elſe all at once. If they came in by little and little, then the books that had beene written without thoſe faults, might bee patternes to correct the fualty by, and ſo the text might bee ſtill preſerved pure, as wee find it was done when Printing flouriſhed under the managing of learned men; in thoſe copies of the <hi>Greeke</hi> Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, printed at <hi>Compludo, and at Paris.</hi> To ſuppoſe they came in all at once, is againſt all reaſon and poſſibilitie of experience. I have ſhewed that till the time of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles, the Old-Teſtament was pure: and can it be ſuppoſed that all the Churches of the <hi>Iewes</hi> in <hi>Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Aſia</hi> and <hi>Bithinia,</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. nay, all the twelue tribes in the Cities of the <hi>Medes,</hi> in places ſo diſtant, ſhould conſpire to ſuch an act for which they were perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they ſhould goe downe irrecoverably to hell? Can the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a baſe <hi>Iewe</hi> or two in a thing of ſo great importance, to the diſgrace of their owne Nation, without any proofe of the thing, naming of the place, time or Perſons, againſt all poſſibilitie of trueth, ſticke ſo faſt, as that no nitre can be able to waſh it off? To ſay that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ever endeavoured to corrupt the Hebrew text, hath yet more impoſsibilities. For during the time of the gift of tongues, no ſuch crime might touch them; and after that, none among them, no not the Fathers themſelues, except perhaps <hi>Origen,</hi> or <hi>Hierom,</hi> had ſo much skill in Hebrew, as to be
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:107656:190"/>able to corrupt it. Beſide, the whole nation of the <hi>Iewes</hi> would have oppoſed it; and as they deteſt our religion and faith, ſo had they had juſt cauſe to brand us with infamy, for that endeavour; and to proclaime our folly, which ſhould corrupt that, in the ſincerity of which alone, is the aſſurance of our hope. So the Hebrew text re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines intier.</p>
                           <p>And concerning the New-Teſtament written in <hi>Greeke,</hi> it was ſo ſuddainely diſperſed among the converts of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and that while ſome of the Apoſtles were yet liuing, that there could be no poſſibilitie of any corruption to come unto the text by any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſent. And becauſe that our Lord was to be made a light unto the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and a ſalvation unto the ends of the earth. <hi>Actes</hi> 13.47. Therefore were the bookes of the New-Teſtament alſo Tranſlated into many languages, even in the birth and infancie of the Church of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as you may read in <hi>Aug. de Doctr. Chr. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 5. in <hi>Chryſ. hom.</hi> 1. in <hi>Iohn:</hi> who alſo tranſlated the Scriptures for the <hi>Armenians,</hi> as <hi>Hierom</hi> for the <hi>Dalmatians</hi> his countrey-men. I ſaid many languages, becauſe they name the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, Ethiopian, Perſian, Syrian, Egyptian, Sarmatian, Scythian;</hi> but <hi>Theodoret De Graec. affect. cur. lib.</hi> 5. ſaith, into all languages which were in uſe. And if it might be put that the <hi>Greeke</hi> copies were cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted; yet theſe Tranſlations being our of them while they were intire, would detect the corruption. But all theſe Tranſlations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Chriſtians, though differing in ſome points one from another, as the <hi>Neſtorians, Euticheans, &amp;c.</hi> doe ſtill agree in the ſubſtance of the meaning, and ſhew the purity of that fountaine from whence they flowed. And there is none of theſe tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or Fathers here named, but were before <hi>Mahumed</hi> of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an became a renegado at leaſt 200. yeeres. All which things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put together, it will be manifeſt that neither the falſhood of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> nor the forgery of <hi>Mahumed</hi> have any ſhew of trueth, but that the Holy Scriptures both of the old and new Teſtament are ſtill in their purity, as the Church received them.</p>

For ſeeing the inſtruction of God muſt be of all ſuch things as are above our knowledge; and yet of ſuch things as are moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for us to know: if nothing be more neceſſary for us to know, than the meanes of our delivery from ſinne and death, by the merit of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it is neceſſary that one needfull thing be made manifeſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us by the Scriptures of God, that every one may know and come freely to the fountaine of living Waters. But what helps a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that is ſealed up?

That <hi>Chriſt</hi> is a ſtone of ſtumbling, and a rocke of offence to the diſobedient; but to them that obey the trueth, elect, and precious.

Therefore, if the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel be uneaſie, or hid, it is hid to them that are without, whoſe eyes the God of this world hath blinded, that they ſhould not perceive the trueth. Therefore as <hi>Chriſt</hi> redeemed the elect, prayes for the elect, not for the world, but for them whom God had given him out of the world, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.9. So the benefits which are peculiar to the Church, of which the true underſtanding of the Scripture is one, belongs to <hi>them, who with an honeſt and pure heart, receive the word, and bring forth fruit with patience.</hi> But it is true, that even to thoſe many things are yet unknowne, and ſome things doubtfull, and this by the diſpenſation of God. 1.

                           <p>§ 7. ANd if the Scripture be for every ones reading, then certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for euery ones interpretation, privately to his owne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, according to the meaſure of his capacity. For the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of any word, or writing, is nothing elſe but the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the native and true meaning thereof; whether it be lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; and that either ſimple or figurative: or myſticall, and that either allegoricall, morall, or anagogicall. But that ought not to bee taken for the true meaning of the Scripture, which every one
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:107656:192"/>according to his private fantaſie, is able to wring out: but that onely is the true and lawfull interpretation thereof, which doth offer it ſelfe according to the meaning of the words, with due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the argument or purpoſe of the text: which is gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by that which goes before, and that which followes after. And this interpretation is eſpecially to be hoped from them, who having knowledge of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greeke,</hi> wherein the Scriptures were originally written, have made it all their ſtudie and delight truely to underſtand them for their owne ſoules health, and the inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of others. But that wee bee not overſwayed by any opinion which wee may have of their learning, or mightineſſe in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, let nothing be taken for a true interpretation of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is diſhonourable to God, contrary to any Article of the faith, or any of the ten Commandements, or the petitions of the Lord prayer, or any received doctrine, which is plainely taught by other places of Scripture. Secondly, nothing which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to common reaſon and underſtanding, or repugnant to civill cuſtome, and good manners.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. No man knoweth the things of God, but onely the Spirit of God; therefore, in the interpretation of doubtfull places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Spirit of God, whereby it was written, muſt give alſo the true underſtanding, or interpretation, thereof: and this Spirit, and the meaning thereof, is moſt eaſily found in the holy Scripture. Therefore the ſureſt, and beſt interpretation of Scripture, is by Scripture it ſelfe.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. The Scribes and Phariſes were to be heard, ſitting in the Chaire of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that is, teaching the Law, according to the true meaning of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Therefore the interpreters of the New-Teſtament alſo, are to be heard, ſpeaking the voice of <hi>Christ.</hi> But His ſheepe will not heare a ſtranger, for they know not the voice of ſtrangers, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. Therefore the interpretation of the Scripture is chiefely by the Scriptures. And by the Scriptures onely, every queſtion of faith and doctrine to bee decided, not by the Church, or any humane voice, except they ſpeake according to the word of the Scripture. 1. For ſeeing the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> is the chiefe judge in all controverſies, on whoſe infallible ſentence wee may ſafely relye, and that the Scriptures are His immediate word, therefore from thence are wee to expect His immediate anſwere; whereas the Church ſpeakes not from God immediately, but as a meane, conueighs unto us the voice of the Scripture. 2. Beſide this, the Church may erre, the Scripture cannot erre. 3. The Scriptures ſhine by their owne light: the Church by the light and Doctrine of the Scriptures. 4. The Scriptures are alwayes at hand to be reſorted unto, the Church never all aſſembled, nor a Councill ſcarce once in an age, and they that vaunt moſt of the name, for the moſt part have leaſt of the true Church. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Prophets ſend us to the Law, and to the Teſtimonies,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:107656:192"/>and our Lord, to ſearch the Scriptures. <hi>See</hi> 2. <hi>Peter</hi> 1.19.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Object.</hi> 2. By this meanes, making it lawfull for every one to reade, and interpret the Scriptures, you ſet open a doore, to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of hereſies to enter into the Church, and make every private ſpirit a judge, and an interpreter of the ſence of Scripture.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Though every one may, and ought to read the Scripture for comfort and inſtruction; yet the interpretation of the harder places, belongs eſpecially to the Paſtours and Doctors appointed by the Church thereto: and if any private man doe interpret ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the former rules, yet cannot that interpretation be ſaid to proceed from a private ſpirit, although the man be private. For the holy Spirit is the common author of all light and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. And the meanes whereby He uſeth to teach, is, the holy Word, the common light of all the faithfull.</p>
                           <p>And this may ſeeme ſufficient to have ſpoken of the Author, and uſe of the holy Scriptures, and what they are: then of their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, purity, eaſineſſe, and interpretation. And bleſſed is that man that meditates in them day and night, that he may finde by them, the full aſſurance of his hopes, and live in obedience and thankefullneſſe to the Author and finiſher of his faith.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Certaine <hi>Iew,</hi> famed for his riches, was once asked by a great lord of the <hi>Turkes,</hi> how it came to paſſe, that the <hi>Turkes,</hi> the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and the <hi>Iewes,</hi> did ſo peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily hold every one their owne faith, that they could not be withdrawne there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from? The <hi>Iew</hi> ſuſpecting his wealth to be aimed at, anſwered, as their manner is, by a witty parable. A rich man (quoth he) had three ſonnes that obſerued him with great reſpect, becauſe of his wealth: he, to hold them all in their obedience, oftentimes profeſt among them, that he ſhould be the heire of all his eſtate, to whom at his death he ſhould bequeath a ring which he uſed to weare: But in ſecret he cauſed <hi>Mammurius</hi> the Goldſmith, to make for him, two other rings, ſo like it, as <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maes ancylia</hi> were not one more like another. At his death he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led each of his ſonnes apart, and gave to every one of them, one of theſe rings and withall, the poſſeſſion of all his goods: ſo every one holds his claime (quoth he) and it is nor yet knowne how the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie will be ended. This is the preſent ſtate of the Church; not onely among theſe three ſects, named, but likewiſe among all the ſects of Chriſtianity; yea, of all religions whatſoever. For
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:107656:194"/>there is none among the <hi>Pagans,</hi> but he hath this hope, that his ſoule ſhall be happy, if he ſerue his god as he ought. And having determined thoſe queſtions which concerne God, and our Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; it followes, that in this ſecond part of the Creed, we conſider thoſe benefits and priviledges which belong unto the Church, by that which our Saviour hath done and ſuffered for it. But that we miſtake not, we ſhall beſt be guided by the holy Scripture, both for the uſe of the word, and for the knowledge of the thing. The word <hi>Eccleſia,</hi> as it ſignifies in the originall, the houſe of religious exerciſes, or a tumultuous aſſembly; as in <hi>Act.</hi> 19.32. or a combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of wicked men, as in <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 26.5. hath no uſe here; but more properly it ſignifieth an aſſembly, or multitude of people, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing the true worſhip of God, ſuch as were the Churches of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, Epheſus,</hi> and others planted by the Apoſtles, and Apoſtolicall men in a City or Kingdome, as we thinke that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> planted the faith in this Iſland, and ſo eſtabliſhed a Church here. Every faithfull family is likewiſe a Church, <hi>Romans</hi> 16.5. and the Church repreſentative, as the <hi>Synedrion</hi> among the <hi>Iewes,</hi> is alſo ſo ſtiled, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.17. But becauſe among all theſe Churches, there may be hypocrites, unholy, and carnally minded men, which we cannot count within our Creed, and beleeve that they are the holy Church, therefore the Church may be taken, not onely for the viſible, but alſo they, whoſe Mediator our Lord <hi>Christ</hi> is, unto eternall life, as he ſaith, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.9. <hi>I pray for them, I pray not for the world, but for them which thou haſt given mee.</hi> From whence it will eaſily appeare, what this holy Catholike or univerſall Church is, which here we doe beleeve, to wit, that number of holy men which God out of all nations of the world, hath predeſtinated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to eternall life. If we cleare the ſence of the words, and anſwere ſuch doubts as ariſe thereabout, we ſhall afterward eaſily approove the Article. And firſt concerning the title of holineſſe given to the Church.</p>

                           <hi>Anſwere.</hi> Not by any inbred holineſſe in themſelues; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the righteouſneſſe of <hi>Christ</hi> their Saviour is imputed unto them for their juſtification before God; as it is ſaid, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.7. <hi>The blood of Ieſus Chriſt clenſeth us from all ſinne:</hi> then becauſe the Spirit of ſanctification dwells in them, and makes them zealous of good workes, that they alſo may bee holy, even as Hee which hath called them is Holy, and that according to the Law, or rule of a ſanctified life, according to which they ought to live, and count it their preſent miſery, that they are ſtill ſubject unto ſinne, and ſo in their ſpirit they ſerve the Law of God, though in their fleſh the law of ſinne: <hi>See Rom.</hi> 1.25.

Neither may wee preſume to forbid them to come unto God, who ſeeme denied of the outward meanes of knowledge, as the deafe, the blind, the Idiots, in as much as God, the God of the ſpirits of all fleſh, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.22. can by His Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit guide the will, and informe the underſtanding as it pleaſes him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.1.

                        <p>The laſt circumſtance is concerning the predeſtination of them that are in this Church: for ſeeing none can be glorified, but they that are juſtified in <hi>Christ:</hi> neither can any one bee juſtified but ſuch as are called and predeſtinate, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. and ſeeing that to the infinite wiſedome of God, all his workes are knowne and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.18. it is impoſſible that any one can be a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of this Church, but onely ſuch as God out of His eternall love hath predeſtinate thereunto.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Object.</hi> But there is one God and Creatour of all, <label type="milestone">

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:107656:195"/>all things according to the counſell of His owne will. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1.11. So man, though made upright, yet being originally corrupted, and left to the hand of his owne will, cannot ceaſe to ſinne. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God permit him to follow his owne wayes; yet that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is no cauſe of any mans ſinne, nor puts it any thing in the reprobate, why he ſhould ſinne.

But if our works fore-ſeene, were any cauſe of our predeſtination. 1. How then could it bee of His mercy onely, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.16? 2.

If God have created good workes, that wee ſhould walke in them, and good workes acceptable to God bee found only in them that are predeſtinate, and choſen to life, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes that good workes are fore-ſeene in us, not as the cauſe, but as the fruits and effects of predeſtination. For if they can be no other than the effects of Gods grace in us, they cannot be fore-ſeene as a cauſe of His grace towards us. This objection is laid to them of the <hi>Romane</hi> Church; but as farre as I have any acquaintance with them, I find no ſuch thing by them. <hi>Tho. Aqu. contr. Gent. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 163. teacheth the contrary, and gives his reaſons. The grace of God (ſaith hee) is an effect of predeſtination, and goes before all humane merit. 2. The Divine will and Providence, are the cauſe of all other things: For of Him, in Him, and for Him are all things. Neither can it be accounted the doctrine of their Church: for in the 7. <hi>Can.

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:107656:195"/>juſtification of man in the ſtate of Nature, are reckoned up, effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, finall, formall, inſtrumentall: the meritorions cauſe is put one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the ſuffering of our Lord, who thereby made full ſatisfaction to God, and merited juſtification for us. And if wee be juſtified one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the merit of <hi>Christ,</hi> and not by any merit fore-ſeene in us, then are we called choſen, and predeſtinate onely in Him through the mercy of God, who <hi>gratuitò,</hi> of his owne free will doth waſh, ſanctifie, and ſeale us by the Holy Spirit of promiſe, who is to us the pledge of our eternall inhoritance: this is the effect of the Canon.</p>

                           <hi>Object.</hi> 3. But how is this Church Catholike or Vniverſall, if any man be ſhut out of it? Or how is it ſaid by <hi>S. Paul.</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. <hi>That God would have all men to bee ſaved,</hi> if there be few that ſhall enter in at the ſtraight gate?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſwere.</hi> The common anſwere to that text of <hi>Timothy</hi> is; that it is ſpoken not <hi>de ſingulis generum,</hi> but <hi>de generibus ſingulorum,</hi> that is, that ſome of every Nation and degree amongſt men ſhall bee ſaved; not every man of every degree. But I ſuppoſe that it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpoken in reſpect of the ordinary means, which in the Church is the Word read and preached, and the Sacraments, by which all men are called to repentance, and faith in <hi>Chriſt:</hi> which if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe, their condemnation is juſt. Alſo out of the viſible Church, nature calls in a ſofter voyce, upon all nations and people of the world; and upon every one in particular to feare God, and to give Him glory which made the heaven and the earth, and all therein. And moreover, the light of every mans conſcience accuſing, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing him, for thoſe things which he doth contrary, or according thereto, is the witneſſe of God in every mans heart, to excuſe or condemne him. And in reſpect of theſe meanes, God may be ſaid to will, that all men ſhould be ſaved, in that he doth offer his mercy to all, and call upon them to turne unto Him, that they might be ſaved; if they want not grace to accept it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Object.</hi> 4. The want of that, is not imputed to any man, which is onely in the power of another to give; and ſeeing that without repentance, faith, hope, and perſeverance in vertue, no man can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to happineſſe; which vertues of repentance, &amp;c. are onely in God to give, as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.21. <hi>Turne Thou us unto thee ô Lord, and ſo ſhall wee bee turned:</hi> it may ſeeme, that the want of theſe things, ought not to be imputed to any man.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſwere.</hi> If any man refuſe a good thing when it is offered, the want of that ſhall be imputed to himſelfe, as to the wicked, that ſaith to God, <hi>Depart from us, for wee deſire not the knowledge of thy wayes, Iob,</hi> 21.14. and theſe are they whom God is ſaid to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; becauſe they have hardened their owne hearts through the cuſtome of ſinne, that they cannot repent. Therefore, though the predeſtinate, that the mercy of God may appeare, are conuerted by the inward and effectuall calling; their hearts being renewed by
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:107656:196"/>repentance, to follow him that calleth; yet that the order of Iuſtice may be obſerved, they that forſake their owne mercy, are ſtill left to the puniſhment of their ſinne, both originall, and actuall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they neglect the outward calling, and wilfully ſhut their eyes againſt the light of their naturall knowledge and conſcience, <hi>See Rom.</hi> 9.21. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And according to this ſence, is it, that in Scripture the hardning of man in ſinne, and the preſeruing man from ſinne, ſeemes to be attributed to God both wayes; as where he is ſaid to harden <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart; and to <hi>Abimelech, (a) Gen.</hi> 20.6. <hi>I have kept thee from ſinning againſt me.</hi>

                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> And thus it being manifeſt what this holy Church is, and of what perſons it doth conſiſt; it followes firſt to proove, that there is ſuch a Catholike Church, as wee ſay wee doe beleeve to bee; then to ſee the differences which are betweene this Catholike Church, and other particular Churches and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 If there were not a number of holy people, which God hath choſen unto eternall life; then the end of <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſufferings for us, were all in vaine, and the whole race of mankind ſhould have beene created onely to deſtruction: So the mercy of God toward His creature, that had ſinned, ſhould be without effect: Neither ſhould His glory be magnified, in ſaving that which was loſt. So the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, the enemy of mankind, might magnifie himſelfe againſt God, in that he had deſtroyed His creature irrecoverably. But all theſe things are impoſſible. Therefore there is a holy Church, choſen of God unto eternall life. And if this holy Church, in the parts, or members thereof, had not continued in all ages, ſince God made His promiſe of a Savior to <hi>Adam,</hi> then faith had fail'd from among men, and the promiſes of God, being either not beleeved, or forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, the ſons of God, begotten by the immortall ſeed, had failed. So the throne of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when there was no faithfull heart wherein He reigned, ſhould not have beene eſtabliſhed for ever, contrary to the promiſe, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 89. <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 29, 36. and <hi>Luke</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 33. So the ſeed of the enemy onely had flouriſhed in the earth, contrary to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of that wiſe husbandman, <hi>Matth</hi> 13.30. <hi>Let both grow to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether untill the harueſt.</hi> But theſe things are impoſſible. Therefore the holy Church is alſo Catholike, or continuing from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to the end of the world. For your better underſtanding, you may take theſe arguments apart.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If the goodneſſe of God, being eſſentially one with His infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, were not diffuſive, or ſpreading it ſelfe upon the creature, for the ſuccour and aid thereof, in the greateſt miſery, then ſhould it be exceeded by the malice and wickednes of the devill, which though it be the greateſt that may be; yet muſt it needs be finite, as having the originall from a finite creature. But it is impoſſible that God ſhould be exceeded by the malice of the devill, therefore there is a reſtoring of man, to that bleſſedneſſe and glory, from which he
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:107656:196"/>fell by his ſinne, as you have ſeene it prooved before, in the 18. <hi>Chapter,</hi> and from all the reaſons there brought, to that concluſion, you may bring reaſons for the proofe of this Article.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. If man were created according to the will of God, innocent, and without ſinne; then that preſent eſtate of ſinne, and death the puniſhment thereof, wherein he now is, muſt needs have beene brought upon him, ſince his creation, contrary to the revealed will of God: wherein, though for the declaration of the juſtice of God againſt ſinne, ſome be ſuffered to continue; yet becauſe ſinne is contrary to the will of God, and death contrary to the end of His creation of mankind; it is neceſſary that there be a redemption, or freeing of ſome appointed thereunto, from the thraldome, both of ſin and death. But it hath beene prooved, <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. that man was created innocent. Therefore there is a Church, or a number knowne unto God, of them that are ſo redeemed.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. There is a God who hath made His promiſes of everlaſting life. There is faith, hope, and repentance, and other vertues both Chriſtian and morall, whereby the promiſes of God are apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and obedience performed to His Commandements. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is a holy Catholike Church. For it is impoſſible, either that the promiſes of God ſhould faile of their performance; or that faith and other vertues ſhould be without their reward. For ſo the Spirit of grace, which wrought theſe vertues in man, ſhould worke in vaine. But this is impoſſible.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. This holy Catholike Church is declared in ſundry places of the holy Scripture; and in ſpecial, according to all the cauſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. <hi>chap.</hi> 1. from <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. to 15. And although Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> in that place write to a particular Church; yet is the Catholike Church no other than ſuch as is there deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed: no more then the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> or <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Seas are different from the great Ocean, either in ſubſtance or qualities. For there is but one body, and one Spirit, one Lord, one faith, one hope, one bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, one God, and Father of all. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4.4, 5, 6. And as there is but one God; ſo is there but one Mediator betweene God and man, the Man <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5, 6. And this one Mediator is that one onely myſticall head of His myſticall body. For there is no name given under heaven, whereby wee muſt be ſaved, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the name of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt, Act.</hi> 4.12. And as there is but one head; ſo is there one onely body, as it is ſaid, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.9. <hi>My Dove, my undefiled is but one,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.16. <hi>There ſhall be one fold, and one ſhepherd:</hi> by which texts of the Holy Writ, it is manifeſt that there is one holy Catholike Church, as wee doe beleeve.</p>
                        <p>§. 3. And by this which hath beene ſaid, it may eaſily appeare what thoſe differences are, betweene this Catholike Church, and other particular congregations, whether in private houſes, or in Cities, Countreys, Kingdomes, or Peoples, which in <hi>Cant.</hi> 6. ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted even now, are ſignified by the Queenes, Concubines, and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:107656:197"/>the innumerable Virgins, which conſent to the ſame points of faith and doctrine.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The firſt, and moſt common is this, that in the Viſible Churches, Hypocrites and Atheiſts are found among the choſen; and theſe are the tares among the wheate, the bad fiſh among the good, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.48. But in this holy Catholike Church, no vile or prophane perſon can bee, as it is ſaid <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. and 22.15. That without the holy Citie, ſhall be doggs, the fearfull, and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, the unbeleeving, murderers, whoremongers, ſorcerers, ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, and every one that loveth and maketh the lie.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. A ſecond difference is in this, that every particular Church is viſible, ſo that every member thereof, may be fully informed of all things whatſoever is taught therein for trueth; either concerning doctrine or diſcipline: but the Catholike Church, in the ſence we here take it neither is, nor ever was, nor can bee viſible, but to the eye of faith alone, as here we confeſſe in our Creed; for faith is the proofe, or argument, of things not ſeene. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.1. If then the Catholike Church be a thing to be ſeene, then is it not to be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; if it be to be beleeved, then muſt it needs be inviſible. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide this, the univerſall, or Catholike Church, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes it, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 13.15. is of the Saints in heaven, as well as of them that are in earth; yea, and of them that are not yet borne, as of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe. And although all the members of this Church, during the time of their pilgrimage upon earth, be viſible, or in a viſible Church; yet, while they are here on earth, we doe not beleeve them to be of that Catholike Church, with that aſſurance of knowledge, which a ſaving faith requires; ſuch a faith I meane, as is due to an Article of our Creed, but onely with that hope, or credulity, which Chriſtian charity, and their holy conuerſation doth bind us to have of them. 3. For as God only knoweth the heart, ſo He only know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth who are His; and if He only know, then cannot we; and though we ſee them in a true particular Church, yet doe we not thereby know that they are true members of the Catholike Church.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Object.</hi> 1. If the true Church be not alwayes viſible, why doth our Lord ſend us to the Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſwer.</hi> That commandement of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhewes what is to bee done in particular viſible Churches, not in the inviſible Catholike Church; and this is to be obſerued in ſuch texts as are like to this, which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> bring, to proove the perpetuall viſibility of the Catholike Church. For if they could make that good, they would hope thereby, to proove the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the Catholike Church. But if the firſt were given, the ſecond would not follow. For was there no Catholike Church before <hi>Romulus</hi> murthered his brother? or, where was the Catholike Church, when <hi>Rome</hi> was yet the mother of all the abominations and filthineſſe of the earth? Firſt in their worſhip of devills; and after, when their lives were anſwerable to their Religion, as you reade in Saint <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 1. and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:107656:197"/>in their owne prophets, <hi>Iuvenal, Arbiter, &amp;c.</hi> and againe, ſince they have forſaken their faith once praiſed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.8. and borne the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer reward of their idolatry? And if that Church be the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church, out of which none can bee ſaved (as they ſay) what ſhall become of all thoſe Chriſtians in the whole world, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all their idolatries and falſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines; as the <hi>Greekes,</hi> and all that follow them, the <hi>Neſtorians, Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobites, Ethiopians,</hi> the reformed Churches in the Weſt, &amp;c. which for the number may ſeeme to be, at the leaſt, five to one to the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,</hi> notwithſtanding their falſe pretended univerſality?</p>
                        <p>To the former differences betweene the Catholike Church and particular congregations, you may adde a third, that any particular Church may erre wholly, both in manners and doctrine, as I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Chap.</hi> before § 7. <hi>N.</hi> 2. but the Catholike Church cannot erre. 4. Any particular Church may faile, or ceaſe to be; but of the kingdome of <hi>Chriſt</hi> there ſhall be no end. Therefore the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church cannot faile; from whence it followeth; 5. That the Catholike Church is of the greateſt antiquity, as having the beginning thereof in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> (for I enquire onely of the Church of the redeemed, not of the Angels) but particular Churches had their beginning afterward, ſome at one time, ſome at another; as that of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> in <hi>Abraham</hi> and his family; that of the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> in the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> &amp;c. 6. Concerning the ſucceſſion of the Catholike Church, there is none ſuch as they account, of Kings, or Biſhops, in this or that See: but becauſe <hi>Chriſts</hi> kingdome cannot faile, therefore there is this ſucceſſion; That before theſe Saints that now live ſhall die, others ſhall be borne, that are the true members of the Church; and thus is there ſtill but one Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church, which unity containes all and every member thereof, in one myſticall body, whereof our Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the Head.</p>

And although theſe queſtions thruſt in themſelues here in this place to be diſcuſſed, ſeeing predeſtination is the eternall foundation of the holy Catholike Church, out of which there is no ſaluation; and into which none can come, but he that is holy: It may ſeeme that it ought to be enquired, what holineſſe we have of our ſelues, or what ſtrength, to come to that holineſſe which we ought to have; and what ſtrength to continue therein.

For beſide the two properties of the Church, to be Holy and Catholike; it is neceſſary to know what the Priviledges or prerogatives are, which belong to that holy congregation, that they may know that their ſeruice is not without reward. Theſe prerogatives are 4.1. This Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of the Saints, which is the ground and aſſurance of the reſt. For from hence it followes, that we may aſſuredly beleeve that our ſins are forgiven, and therefore that our bodies ſhall riſe againe, and that to everlaſting life. But this Communion of the Saints is two-fold; 1. Among themſelves: Secondly, in the participation of thoſe bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits which are purchaſed for them by the merit of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Yet this Communion among themſelves, is rather a third property, than a priviledge of the holy Church, and ariſeth from that Communion which we have with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> For he that loveth Him that begetteth, loveth him alſo that is begotten of Him, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.1, 2.

And this not onely in the ſupply of outward helpes, as it appeared, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.32. but much more in like affection one toward another, in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er one for another, in ſupporting each the infirmitie of other, as one member of the body is ever helpfull to another, in comforting, in exhorting, and in the Spirit of Meekenes admoniſhing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and every one in himſelfe, giving an example of a vertuous, and honeſt life, according to that commandement, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good workes, and glorifie your Father which is in heaven.</hi> And theſe things proceed from that inward and ſpirituall Communion which wee have with God the Father, and with His Son <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> as it is ſaid, 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1.3. For ſeeing wee know, <hi>That God ſo loved the world, as that He gave His Son to die for the life of the world, wee ought alſo to love the brethren.</hi> So likewiſe the ſpirituall Communion, or participation of thoſe benefits whereof wee are partakers by the merit of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſtands altogether in this, that He our Mediator, God and Man, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given Himſelfe a ranſome for us: God doth not now looke on us as wee are in our ſelues, corrupted in our ſinnes, but as wee are waſhed, but as wee are ſanctified, but as wee are juſtified in the name of the Lord <hi>Ieſus,</hi> and by the Spirit of our God, as wee are one body with His Son, and He our head, is become our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, our ſanctification and redemption: So that through Him, wee haue not onely theſe priviledges here mentioned; of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of our ſinnes, reſurrection, and life; but alſo having in <hi>Chriſt</hi> the adoption of ſonnes, wee have by Him an entrance unto God the Father, a right and intereſt in the eternall inheritance of the Kingdome of Heaven, and whatſoever may bee availeable to our eternall happineſſe, for the gift was not as the offence, as you might ſee, <hi>Chap.</hi> 18. §. 2. For as we know that <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord, the eternall Son, was partaker of our nature, and are likewiſe aſſured, that the greateſt actions of God in His creature, are for the greateſt good that can come neere the creature: So ought wee to bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that we alſo ſhall be made the ſons of God, by that Spirit of God that dwelleth in us, as it is ſaid, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. <hi>He that is joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Lord, is one Spirit.</hi> And theſe are the exceeding great and precious promiſes, that God hath made unto us in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that by Him wee ſhall bee made partakers of the divine nature. 2. <hi>Peter</hi> 1.4. this is that union, and Communion for which our Lord prayes that it may bee made perfect in us, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.21, 22, 23.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. For ſeeing the ſoule of man is a thing whoſe excellencie doth ſo farre exceed all things of this world: it may not be thought that the happineſſe and perfection of the ſoule can ſtand in things that are inferiour to it ſelfe: as in riches, honour, worldly pleaſure, or the like: But ſeeing it knowes that there is one onely infinite goodnes, which becauſe it is infinite, muſt needs be eternall, and able to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie all the deſire of the creature that can bee partaker thereof:
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:107656:199"/>therefore doth it aſpire thereunto, becauſe in the injoying of that alone, it can be made perfect. And if this deſire of the ſoule ſhould be in vaine, then the Holy Spirit of God which wrought this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire in the ſoule, ſhould have wrought in vaine: then the infinite goodneſſe, which might ſatisfie the deſire of the creature, ſhould be defective toward the creature, and conſequently not infinite: then the promiſes of God made in His word ſhould faile, and the prayer of our Mediator, cited even now from <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. without ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. But all theſe things are impoſſible. Therefore there is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Saints with God, and with one another, as wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe in the article.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If the merit of <hi>Chriſt</hi> bee infinite, and that not for Himſelfe, but for His body, which is the Church, then it is neceſſary that an infinite reward be given thereto. But the merit of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is infinite, both actively and paſſively. Therfore an infinite reward is due to us thereby: So that by the Spirit of <hi>Chriſt</hi> which is in us, we have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion both with the Father, and the Sonne, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.3.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. All the dignities of God are infinite, and they are all to bee manifeſted in the creature, ſo farre forth as the creature can bee made capable thereof. <hi>Ergo.</hi> Now the foundation and originall of communion is in this, that for as much as the children are partakers of fleſh and blood, He alſo Himſelfe tooke part of the ſame, that through death He might deſtroy him that had the power of death, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2.14. and that to this end, that wee might be partakers of His immortality, and from that union of the divine and humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whereby our Lord, of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> became one with all man-kind, ariſeth that ſpirituall and myſticall union of us with Him, that howſoever we are abſent in body, yet being renewed by the Spirit of our mind, we live unto Him, &amp; have Him evermore abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in us, as we evermore abide in him, &amp; daily more &amp; more grow up with Him into one myſtical body, as if we were fleſh of His fleſh, and bone of His bones, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.30. and from this myſtical union, we have the aſſurance of that glorious vnion which ſhall be in heaven, when we ſhalbe joyned to our head inſeparably: and this is that vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or communion which all the faithfull hope for, whereof we have the aſſurance of His promiſes in His Holy word, the ſignes and pledges of the Holy ſupper, and the witneſſe of the holy Spirit of God in our hearts. And thus is <hi>Chriſt</hi> ours, with His graces, and His merits, and thus according to the exceeding great and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promiſes, are wee made partakers of the divine nature: not that wee participate of the incommunicable eſſence of the deitie; but that by the renewing of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> wee put off our corrupt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and are transformed in our minds according as His Divine power doth give us all things that belong to life and godlineſſe.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing is of God alone, whoſe being, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is infinite, therefore muſt it hold in it ſelfe, all the extreamities of being; ſo that nothing that is, can poſſible be, but by Him: therefore, ſeeing the ſoule, the body, and the abilities thereof, are from God alone; the devill can claime no intereſt in man, in reſpect of any of theſe: for none of theſe had their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall from him. But becauſe he was a murtherer from the beginning, and inſpired his inbred poyſon into man, even from the beginning: the root of man-kind being thereby poyſoned, the venome ſpreads throughout all his race, to corrupt both his underſtanding and his will; that ſo his actions being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the ill, which he wilfully committeth, his being alſo may become abominable: But as the Phyſicians make a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the body and the diſeaſe; ſo He, our gracious healer, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes betweene the being, His owne worke, and the corruption thereof, the tares, (I meane) which the envious man ſowed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, to ſave his owne worke, and to caſt the venome, and the effects thereof, on the face of the enemy, to the increaſe of his eternall damnation: and firſt heales the underſtanding, that it may ſee the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:107656:201"/>ſinne; then the will, that he may deteſt and avoid it. And thus, by the renewing of the mind, are we transformed from the image of the devill, and that ſtampe which his ſinne did ſet upon us; So that the ſatisfaction being made to the infinite juſtice, both for our originall and actuall ſinne, the workemanſhip of God, even our whole being may be glorifyed with that glory for which it was created, which alſo it had in the eternall decree before this world was. And becauſe our great weakeneſſe, cauſed of our inbred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and our many ſinnes enſuing thereupon, doth every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſtand up, as a wall of ſeparation, betweene our God and us; therefore hath God given unto us, ſuch aſſured hopes of His mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that although we fall, we ſhall not be caſt away, becauſe the Lord putteth under His hand, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 37.21. and ſuſtaineth us with this confidence, That although our ſins be as red as ſcarlet, yet they ſhall be made more white then ſnow, <hi>Eſay</hi> 1.18. And becauſe this hope and confidence, ought alwayes to be before our eyes, as being the ſure ſtay and anchor of our ſoules; therefore is nothing more fully aſſured unto us, then this, among all thoſe things which we doe beleeve. Stay thou trembling and fearefull ſoule, and though the ugly viſage of thy monſtrous ſinnes make thee afraid, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are ſo much the more hideous and deformed, becauſe they are not onely againſt the Law of God, but againſt the law of reaſon, rightly judging, and againſt thine owne conſcience: yet ſtay and ſee what hope there is for thee; and though that meſſenger of hell, <hi>Deſpaire,</hi> with all that wretched traine of all thy ſinne, which he brings with him, doth hunt thee ſo cloſe, that thou dareſt not ſtay, though thou wouldeſt be any thing, ſave that thou art; and moſt of all, nothing at all: yet ſee if a doore of hope, as wide as the valley of <hi>Achor, Hoſ.</hi> 2.15. be not ſet open for thee, onely if thou wilt be intreated to goe in, and be ſaved.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Thou objecteſt the wrath of God, from which there is no avoidance. But are not all men borne under one ſtate of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption? and who can ſay his heart is cleane? if God then ſhould be extreame, to marke what is done amiſſe, who can abide it? and if every ſinne, in as much as it is againſt an infinite ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, deſerues eternall puniſhment, can no man be ſaved? So all man-kind ſhould have beene created onely to puniſhment: but this is againſt the infinity of His goodneſſe, who is full of compaſſion, ſlow to anger, and great in mercy, good to all, and His tender mercies are above all His workes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144.8, 9. Therefore there is forgiveneſſe of ſinnes.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Therefore is the ſinne of the wicked angels unpardonable, becauſe it was wilfull in them, becauſe they cannot repent them of it, and becauſe they have no mediator to make ſatisfaction for their ſinne. All which (through the mercy of God) to us are found contrary in the ſinne of man: for neither was his ſinne wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, or of himſelfe alone, but from the devill which tempted him
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:107656:201"/>thereto; neither is it without repentance, in all that belong to God; neither is it without a Mediator that is able to make ſatisfaction fully for all our ſinnes. But when all ſufficient meanes are orderly diſpoſed for an end, it is impoſſible but that the end ſhould follow. Therefore there is a forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, as we are taught to pray.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Glory and happineſſe is not given, till ſinnes be firſt forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; So that if there be not a forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, the greateſt and moſt excellent vertues muſt for ever remaine without reward. For we ſee that in this life, vertue is ſo farre from reward, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme, that it is rather perſecuted with hatred and contempt, as the Proverbe hath it, <hi>Virtutis comes inuidia.</hi> And if vertue can find no reward, neither in this life, nor in that which is to come; then the goodneſſe and juſtice of God ſhould be defective. But this is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible; therefore there is forgiveneſſe of ſinnes.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Change the termes of the firſt reaſons in the 18. <hi>Chapter,</hi> and they are eaſily brought to this concluſion. So from the reaſons for the Catholike-Church, and from many other, this Article is eaſily concluded, as you may ſee by the reaſon following.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. <hi>Christ</hi> tooke not on Him the nature of Angels, but He tooke on Him the ſeed of <hi>Abraham. Hebr.</hi> 2.16. For it behooved Him in all things, to be made like unto His brethren, that He might bee a mercifull and faithfull High Prieſt, in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the ſinnes of the people: therefore was Hee made a little leſſe then the Angels, that Hee might ſuffer death for our ſinnes; and this, that Hee might aboliſh his power, that had the power of death, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2.14, 15, 16, 17. but nothing of all this for any benefit to Himſelfe: but for us was He borne, for us He died, and roſe againe, and ſitteth at the right hand of God, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king interceſſion for us. And theſe are the glorious workes which were given unto Him of the Father to doe for us, and cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be in vaine. Therefore ſeeing He Himſelfe became our ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (for the things of heaven are not knowne, but by the Regiſters of heaven) <hi>See Hebr.</hi> 10.7. and 7.22. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Eſay</hi> 53.4.5.6.8.11.12. and hath in His owne body borne the puniſhment of our ſinnes upon the tree. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. it cannot ſtand with the juſtice of God, to exact that debt of us which our ſurety hath ſatiſfied. And therefore it followes that our ſinnes are forgiven us.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. And that I may at once decide this queſtion, both by reaſon and authority alſo of holy Writ, and give full comfort and hope to thee (poore ſoule) that art preſſed downe, even to the gates of hell, under the burthen of thy ſinnes: ſtay and ſee if thy comforts be not greater then thou hadſt thought. Firſt it is a cleare caſe, that no mans life is juſtly call'd in queſtion, but by the plaine and manifeſt letter of the Law. Thou wilt ſay, that is thy deſperate caſe, For it is written, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.26. <hi>Curſed is hee, that confirmeth not all the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:107656:202"/>words of this Law, to doe them:</hi> ſo is the Letter (I confeſſe) but that is now cancell'd, and that by the interpretation of the Law it ſelfe, builded upon one and the ſame juſtice with the former; as where it is ſaid, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.4. <hi>The juſt ſhall live by faith;</hi> then not by doing the workes of the Law, although it be moſt juſt, <hi>that he that doth the workes of the Law, ſhould live therein, Levit.</hi> 18.5. as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.12. for Lawes are made for the preſeruation of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſociety in generall, ſo for the ſafety and defence of every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent in particular, that doing well they may be without feare, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.3. But <hi>Christ</hi> our Saviour, though He were ſeparate from ſinners, though no deceit were found in His mouth, lived not in His innocency, by the patronage of the Law. And if the Law had not power to give life to the innocent; neither in juſtice can it have power to condemne the guilty; and if no fleſh ſhall be juſtified by the workes of the Law, <hi>Galat.</hi> 2.16. but that all men thereby ſtand guilty before God; what madneſſe is it, to ſeeke life by that which brings the ſentence of condemnation, and that upon all men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently? And if <hi>Christ Ieſus</hi> be of God made unto us, Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Righteouſneſſe, Sanctification and Redemption, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. what ſhall we need to feare the condemnation of the Law, which through the infirmity of our fleſh was unable to give life, or ſeeke any other righteouſneſſe, then that which by faith we have in him? And if He be our righteouſneſſe, how can the Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne us, when He hath fulfilled it for us? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3, 4. therefore comfort thy ſelfe in God. <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe hope is in the Lord his God, and though thy hopes be weake, nay, though thou walke in darkeneſſe, and have no light; yet truſt in the Name of the Lord, and ſtay upon thy God, Eſay</hi> 50.10. <hi>And though thy conſcience condemne thee, yet God is greater then thy conſcience, and knoweth all things</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.20.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Objection</hi> 1. It is not long agoe, that certaine men from the mint of their owne braine, ſought to give out a coyne under their owne ſtampe. That we are not juſtified by the active righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of <hi>Christ,</hi> but by that which was paſſive onely: and another like this. That we are not bound to the obſeruation of the Law delivered by <hi>Moſes,</hi> either Iudiciall, Ceremoniall, or Morall. But becauſe this coyne had not the publike ſtampe, it was accounted falſe; and therefore this laſt argument of yours, which drawes ſo neere to their laſt poſition, may ſeeme to be fallacious. The Law defended not the innocent, <hi>ergo</hi> it cannot condemne the guilty. Who knowes not that the juſt Law was moſt unjuſtly wreſted againſt our Saviour, that Hee ought to die, becauſe He ſaid, Hee was the Sonne of God; when as in the caſe of treaſon againſt <hi>Caeſar,</hi> upon His owne interpretation, He was acquited by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane deputy.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſwere.</hi> So He was pronounced innocent againſt all their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther objections, and yet His innocency ſaved Him not. Yet His
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:107656:202"/>caſe was a reſerved caſe, in as much as He was no private man: but even the Head of His Church, who had ſet Himſelfe to anſwere for all His members, and therefore when the Law protected not Him, who was innocent above all men, and for all men, it condemned it ſelfe as unable to give life: and therefore the concluſion is good, that it is not of any power to condemne any of them who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in Him that was innocent. But that I may anſwere more particularly: I ſay that I am farre from theſe men, in both their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions.</p>
                        <p>For although the things which our Lord did, ſo farre forth as wee can imitate them, are examples for us, yet not onely for example, but alſo for our juſtification, that the law of perfect righteouſneſſe being fulfilled for us, wee might bee freed from the curſe of the Law. Moreover by that active righteouſneſſe which our Saviour performed, He was able to ſave all that come unto God by Him, whereas if it might be ſuppoſed, that God and man in one perſon could ſinne (as the devill tempted Him) then His ſuffering had beene onely ſufficient for Himſelfe, whereas now, His death was meritorious for all. For as that ſuppoſed ſinne had beene infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite both in reſpect of the perſon againſt whom, and the perſon by whom it had beene done, being an infinite Perſon, ſo muſt it have had an infinite ſatisfaction; So all that <hi>Christ</hi> had merited by His death, had beene available onely for Himſelfe: but now being offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a <hi>Lambe</hi> without ſpot, His ſacrifice is ſufficient for all that come unto God by Him. Then for that other opinion, that wee are not bound to the fulfilling of the Law, it is moſt falſe. For though the Iudiciall were peculiar to <hi>Iſraels</hi> common wealth, and the ceremoniall Law ſerved onely till the ſubſtance was exhibited; yet the morall Law, in regard of the eternall Iuſtice and equitie thereof, as the law of nature, may not be broken without ſinne: nay, ſo much more ſtraightly are wee bound to the performance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as the thoughts are more unruly than the actions, otherwiſe what meant thoſe interpretations of the Law, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, fetch't from the innermoſt meaning of Iuſtice, which binds the very thoughts: It hath beene ſaid to them of old, &amp;c. <hi>But I ſay unto you, Love your enemies: and whoſoever luſts, hath committed adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery in his heart, &amp;c.</hi> Is not our Lord a ſufficient Law-giver for His Church? Doe they take away ſinne out of the world, and ſo make void the death of <hi>Christ? For where no Law is, there is no ſinne imputed. Rom.</hi> 5.13. I confeſſe that the Law hath no power over them that are in <hi>Christ,</hi> to eternall death, becauſe it was inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to protect His innocent life, although the keeping of the Law, if it were exact, might claime to eternall life. But the works of the Law, and faith in <hi>Christ,</hi> are by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſet in direct oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this argument of juſtification, <hi>See Rom.</hi> 3. from <hi>verſe</hi> 20. &amp;c. And <hi>Galatians, Chapter</hi> 3. But yet though obedience cannot bring life eternall to the doer of the Law, becauſe
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:107656:203"/>the Law is perfect, our obedience imperfect; yet ſinne brings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved death upon the ſinner, whereby their vanitie appeares, which hold the keeping of the law not neceſſary: and likewiſe the trueth of the former concluſion, that ſeeing the keeping of the law gave not life to our Lord that fulfilled it, neither can the breach of the Law bring condemnation to them that are in Him, to whom there is no condemnation. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1.</p>
                        <p>

                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>2</label> But ſeeing the merit of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is infinite, and He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both God and man, of infinite worthineſſe above the creature; and for this purpoſe appearing, that He might take away the ſinnes of the world: how comes it to paſſe, that after the ſacrifice for ſin is offered, yet both ſinne, and death the puniſhment thereof, doe ſtill remaine?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſwere.</hi> It was an eaſie thing for God utterly to have aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed death, after that by ſinne, it had entered into the world; ſo that neither the body ſhould have died the naturall death, nor the ſoule the ſpirituall death of ignorance, and pleaſure in ſinne, nor both together the death eternall. But yet God would let both ſin and death remaine, and that for foure reaſons eſpecially. Firſt, that the juſtice of His moſt righteous ſentence might ſtand. <hi>In the day that thou eateſt of that tree of the knowledge of good and ill, thou ſhalt die the death.</hi> 2. That the infinitie of His wiſedome and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe might appeare; that as death by ſinne had entered into the world, ſo by death he might deſtroy ſinne: that whereas the devill which had the power of death, ſought to deprive man of life and glory, He might take the weapon out of the hand of that <hi>Egyptian,</hi> and as <hi>Benajah,</hi> kill him with his owne ſpeare, and by death bring man to everlaſting glory. 3. That man might ſee the greatneſſe of the benefit, and willingly conforme himſelfe to follow <hi>Chriſt</hi> through the paines of death, and horrour of the grave, ſeeing God hath called and predeſtinated us to be like the image of His Son. 4. The devills fell by pride, and leaſt man ſhould grow proud, therefore is ſinne and death left with him, to humble him thereby: So that to the faithfull, the condition of death onely is changed. For whereas juſtice would that man ſhould die, becauſe the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death had proceeded againſt him; And mercy would not the death of a ſinner, Wiſedome decided it, that death ſhould bee made the way to everlaſting life, and ſo both Iuſtice and mercy might have what they deſired.</p>

                           <hi>Anſwere.</hi> The meaning and purpoſe of this Article of our faith, is, that wee ſtedfaſtly beleeve the forgiveneſſe of our ſinnes, ſo that they ſhall not riſe up in judgement againſt us to our eternall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. But concerning the temporary puniſhment in this world, we muſt remember that which is, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.6. <hi>Whom the Lord loveth He chaſtizeth, and ſcourgeth every one whom He receiveth.</hi> And
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:107656:203"/>this appeareth moſt plainely in <hi>David,</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. whoſe ſinne though God had put away, that he ſhould not die; yet was it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward puniſhed to every circumſtance, as you may read. And though all chaſtiſement for the preſent bee grievous: yet are not afflictions brought upon men, but onely for their humilitie, and exerciſe of their faith and patience; or to turne them from their ſinne that they may repent, and be made partakers of His holineſſe; and ſo the eternall remiſſion of their ſinnes, made ſure unto them according to His promiſe, <hi>Eſay</hi> 43.25. <hi>I, even I am He that put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out thine iniquities, for Mine owne ſake, and will not remember thy ſinnes.</hi> And againe, <hi>Eſay</hi> 44.22. <hi>I will put away thy tranſgreſsions as a Cloud, and thy ſinnes as a miſt: Turne thee unto mee, for I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed thee:</hi> Read further. <hi>Eſay.</hi> 53. from <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. to the end, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.18.19. <hi>He retaineth not wrath for ever, becauſe mercy pleaſeth Him: He will turne againe and have compaſsion upon us; Hee will ſubdue our iniquities, and caſt all our ſinnes into the hottome of the Sea.

                        <p>§ 1. <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T may ſeeme that the Chriſtian mans hopes are more glorious then all other hopes, becauſe he is ſo well content, with patience to expect the promiſes, and to deferre his hopes to be enjoyed in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter life then this; yea, for thoſe hopes ſake, to deny himſelfe many pleaſures and contents in this preſent life; an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument doubtleſſe, as of a conſtant hope, ſo of an inuincible courage; that for this hopes ſake, becauſe he judgeth Him faithfull that hath promiſed, he beareth patiently all oppoſitions, perſecutions, and all things elſe whatſoever may ſeeme to ſtand againſt this hope of happineſſe in the life to come: which conſtancy is ſo much the more to bee praiſed, becauſe it is of a hope above hope, ſeeing all reaſon and cauſes in nature are againſt it; inſomuch as with them that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it not, it was ſcoffed at, as you reade <hi>Act.</hi> 17.32. or elſe accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted madneſſe, as <hi>Act.</hi> 26.24. yea, and where the great teacher of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> takes upon him to aſcertaine this doctrine of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. he brings his maine proofe eſpecially to this purpoſe; That it is to be held a Goſpel, which we are to receive as a
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:107656:205"/>matier of faith, which of it ſelfe is the ſubſtance and proofe of things hoped for. We ſhall conſider the validity of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> arguments in their due place, in the meane time what hope we may have from them who undertake to give proofe of this Article by naturall reaſon, you may ſee by that which <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> hath brought, <hi>contra Gentiles lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 79. The ſoule (quoth he) is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, and naturally united to the body, as the forme thereof. Therefore it is againſt the nature of the ſoule, to be out of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and nothing that is contrary to nature, can bee perpetuall. Therefore it is neceſſary that it be againe united to the body, that the body may riſe againe. To this reaſon it may be replied, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is, or can be put in nature, whereby the ſoule being once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, is againe reunited to the body: but that is a thing tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending nature and onely in the will and power of God. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the reſurrection be indeed a naturall thing, in reſpect of the termes, that is, the body and the ſoule; becauſe neither the body, nor yet the ſoule, is any perfect ſpecies in nature, ſeeing they are made one for the other, and the ſoules deſire of being with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is never ſatisfied but in the body; yet in reſpect of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or cauſe which ſhould joyne them together, being ſeparated, the reſurrection is above nature, and therefore cannot be enforced by any naturall reaſon. For the ſoule, by any diſeaſe or other cauſe contrary to nature, being driven out of the body; there is no natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall cauſe left, either in the one, or in the other, which is able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite them: for if ſo, then that cauſe would have beene of force to have retained the ſoule ſtill in the body, that it ſhould not have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted therefrom: And therefore that axiome, That nothing which is againſt nature can be perpetuall, hath no force to inferre the reſurrection, which depends onely on the will, the mercy and juſtice of Almighty God, and not on any thing that is in nature. The ſecond reaſon is this.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That which is imperfect in the being thereof, cannot be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of perfect happineſſe. The ſoule ſeparate from the body, is in the being thereof imperfect; in as much as being a part of man, it is not perfect, but in the whole man ſoule and body together; Therefore it is neceſſary that the ſoule be againe united to the body, that both may be perfectly happy together.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The perfect happineſſe of the ſoule and body together, is a promiſe of grace, and utterly beyond the ſtate of nature, and ſo no naturall argument of the reſurrection. But the perfection of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is either naturall, or connaturall: The perfection, which I call naturall, ſhall be onely in the ſtate of glory, when the naturall parts of man, ſoule and body, ſhall be joyned together according to the perfection of their ſeverall being after the reſurrection. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall perfection of the reaſonable ſoule, is that which is in knowledge and contemplation of things that are divine. The ſoule being ſeparate, becauſe it is freed from that variable and fraile
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:107656:205"/>companion of the fantaſie, which followes the appetite, <hi>and dieth with the body, Pſalm.</hi> 146.4. is better fitted to that perfection which is in contemplation, then while it dwelt with the body, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſees that there is no poſſibility in nature, of any returne to the body, it is with all patience and joy, content to expect till Gods appointment be, that it ſhall returne, as it was ſaid to the ſoules of the Saints, That they ſhould reſt for a little ſeaſon, untill their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Martyrs time were fulfilled, <hi>Revel.</hi> 6.11. So that although for the perfect happineſſe of both, the ſoule is to be joyned to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; yet that joyning followes not for the deſires ſake of the ſoule, but for His wills ſake who hath promiſed ſuch happineſſe unto both ſoule and body.</p>
                        <p>Thus you ſee that the glorious hopes which the holy Chriſtian faith brings with it, are above all the reaſons and poſſibilities of nature. Therefore let us not ſeeke naturall proofes for the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, but from the light of grace, and the vertues of the divine dignities which the holy Scriptures have made us to know; let us ſee what arguments we can finde of more ſtrength and ſolidity. And becauſe the reaſons that are to bee brought for proofe of this Article will follow eaſily enough, if it be made manifeſt that the will and decree of God upon all man-kind is, that there ſhall be a reſurrection both of the juſt and unjuſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 24.17. I will firſt bring the holy Oracles thereto; then the reaſons that accord with them; and laſtly anſwere ſuch objections as <hi>Atheiſts</hi> are wont to bring to the contrary.</p>
                        <p>That which is in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>The ſeed of the woman ſhall breake the head of the ſerpent,</hi> in <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.8. is interpreted, <hi>ſhall deſtroy the workes of the devill,</hi> that is, ſinne, and the puniſhment thereof, death; which cannot be, except the dead be raiſed againe. <hi>Iob</hi> 19.25. <hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that Hee ſhall ſtand at the later day upon the earth; and though, after my skinne, wormes deſtroy this body, yet in my fleſh ſhall I ſee God: whom I ſhall ſee for my ſelfe, and mine eyes ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, and not another, though my reines be conſumed within me.</hi> Which text, though it be as plaine and direct for the reſurrection, as any other in the Scripture, yet <hi>Iohn Mercerus</hi> rejects that ſence, becauſe the Hebrew Commentators doe not ſo expound it. <hi>Eſay</hi> 26.19, 21. <hi>Thy dead men ſhall live together, with My dead body ſhall they riſe: awake and ſing ye that dwell in the duſt, for the earth ſhall caſt out her dead. For behold, the Lord commeth out of His place to puniſh the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth alſo ſhall diſcloſe her blood, and ſhall no more hide her ſlaine.</hi> Reade to this purpoſe, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 37. all. And if you ſay, that the calling of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> is there propheſied, in that Metaphor; yet remember that no Metaphor is taken from things that are not. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Of them that ſleepe in the duſt, many ſhall awake to everlaſting life; ſome to ſhame and everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting contempt. Hoſea</hi> 13.14. <hi>I will ranſome them from the power of the grave, I will redeeme them from death: ô death! I will bee thy
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:107656:206"/>plagues; ô grave! I will be thy deſtruction: repentance is hid from mine eyes. Iohn</hi> 5.28, 29. <hi>The houre is comming, in which all that are in the graves ſhall heare His voyce, and ſhall come forth: they that have done good, to the reſurrection of life; and they that have done ill, to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of damnation.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. <hi>Wee muſt all appeare before the judgement ſeat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that which He hath done, whether it be good or ill.</hi> So by theſe texts, among many other, it being manifeſt that God hath decreed a reſurrection for the bodies of men, both good and bad: it being alſo manifeſt, that nothing is impoſſible unto Him, but that <hi>He doth whatſoever it pleaſeth Him, in the heaven, and earth, in the ſeas, and all deepe places, Pſal.</hi> 135.6. it muſt follow of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that there ſhall be a reſurrection; which, that ye may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter apprehend, we will adde ſome reaſons that accord hereto.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. And firſt of all, that argument which our Lord <hi>Ieſus</hi> brings to this purpoſe: <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.32. <hi>I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Iſaac, and the God of Iacob,</hi> but God is not the God of the dead, but of the living. Therefore <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> though they be now dead, yet muſt they riſe againe, for all men live to Him, that is, are in His power to be brought againe unto life when Hee will. To know the ſtrength of this argument, you muſt looke to that which is, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. <hi>I will eſtabliſh My Covenant with thee, and with thy ſeed for an everlaſting Covenant.</hi> But no covenant can bee everlaſting, if either of the parties die. Therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, that is, the faithfull cannot periſh, but evermore live unto God, as it is ſaid in <hi>Luk.</hi> 20.38. <hi>For to this end Christ both died, and revived, and roſe againe, that Hee might bee Lord both of the dead and living:</hi> the dead He ſaith, that they may live againe. For if our Lord <hi>Ieſus</hi> died to purchaſe eternall life for us, it is impoſſible that we ſhould not live eternally.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The arguments of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. fall as thicke as haile, and that firſt argument, in the firſt place, ſtands thus. 1. It is a Goſpel which he received, and preached unto them according to the Scriptures; And ſeeing the doctrine of God, for His owne authoritie, being the God of Trueth, is to be received, for our reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence only which we owe to him, we ought to beleeve it. Hitherun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to tend thoſe words. <hi>v.</hi> 3. and 4. <hi>For I delivered unto you that which I received, that Christ died for our ſins, according to the Scriptures, and that He was buryed, and that He roſe againe the third day according to the Scriptures.</hi> 2. And from this ground of faith, he doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. that there is a reſurrection, to wit, for them that die in the faith of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> For <hi>Chriſt</hi> died not for Himſelfe, but for our ſinnes, and roſe againe for our juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. 3. Since by man came death, by man alſo came the reſurrection of the dead. <hi>verſ.</hi> 21, 22. For the well-being of the body cannot bee but by the head. 4. <hi>verſ.</hi> 25. Hee muſt reigne untill He have put all His ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies under His feete, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.1. Therefore death alſo ſhall be
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:107656:206"/>ſubdued. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The bodies of men kept under His power, ſhall riſe againe. 5. If the bodies of men riſe not againe, theſe abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities and inconueniences muſt follow. That they that are dead in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are periſhed, and while they lived here, were of all men moſt miſerable. Our preaching, and your faith is vaine. We are falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of God, ye are yet in your ſin. They that are baptized over the dead, are baptized in vaine: we are needleſly in danger every houre for the preaching, and beleefe of this doctrine. My contention at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus</hi> hereabout, was to no purpoſe. The <hi>Epicure</hi> that lives to eate and drinke, is the only happy man. But theſe things are impoſſible, and amongſt <hi>Chriſtians</hi> accounted incredible. Therefore there is a reſurrection, His doctrine in other Epiſtles, is to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. 6. <hi>If the Spirit of Him that raiſed up Ieſus from the dead dwell in you, He that raiſed up Christ from the dead, ſhall alſo quicken your mortall bodies by His ſpirit that dwelleth in you.</hi> This argument from the communitie of the Spirit, you may underſtand by <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. §. 4. <hi>n.</hi> 2. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21. 7. <hi>Hee ſhall change our vile bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, that it may be faſhioned like to His glorious body, according to the working, whereby Hee is able even to ſubdue all things to Himſelfe.</hi> 8. The hope of the reſurrection, as it is a comfort againſt all the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and afflictions of this life, ſo eſpecially againſt ſorrow for them that depart from hence, as you read, 1. <hi>Theſ. Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>verſ.</hi> 13, 14. &amp;c. 9. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. <hi>All muſt appeare before the judgement ſeat of Chriſt,</hi> therefore the dead ſhall riſe againe. 10. For none of us liveth to himſelfe, and no man dieth to himſelfe; <hi>For whether wee live or die, wee are the Lords. Rom.</hi> 14.7, 8, 9. Therefore the dead ſhall riſe againe.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. If there be a reſurrection of the dead, then the love of God may extend it ſelfe eternally towards man, according to that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of compaſſion and love, than which, none can be greater: So that not onely our ſins be forgiven eternally, but alſo thoſe mercies vouchſafed which we can neither deſerue, nor thinke of, becauſe His love hath not whither it may extend it ſelfe any further: and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the will and underſtanding of man, may know and love God in that excellency and perfection of love, which is poſſible to man, in his perfection to performe. But if there be no reſurrection, neither of theſe things can bee. Therfore it is expedient that there bee a reſurrection.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. An infinite goodneſſe is ſufficient, and able to fulfill all the good deſires of the creature; both of the ſoule with knowledge, with joy, with love, and all other vertues which it can hope or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire: of the body alſo in giving of it health, ſtrength, activitie: for heavy and elementall, to make it ſpirituall; for earthly, to make it heavenly; to bee ſerviceable in every reſpect to the deſires of the mind; to paſſe from place to place, to dilate or contract it ſelfe; to appeare, or diſappeare, &amp;c. Which if the infinite goodneſſe never ſhould, nor would performe to the creature, then had He put into
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:107656:207"/>the creature a hope, and expectation of happineſſe, above that which He meant to performe: So the imagination of goodneſſe ſhould be greater than the reall goodneſſe, and our apprehenſions more large, and an infinite goodneſſe ſhould not be able to anſwere the finite deſires of the creature. But all theſe things are impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. <hi>Ergo.</hi> It is neceſſarie that there bee a reſurrection of the body, and life everlaſting, whereby the expectation of man ſhall be fulfilled.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. The Law of God is the patterne of perfect juſtice; And His infinite juſtice requires, that reward bee given to every one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, as he hath broken or obſerved it, and that according to the meaſure of His infinite juſtice, ſo farre forth as a finite creature can bee capeable. Therefore there ſhall bee a reſurrection of the fleſh, eſpecially by the luſts, whereof the divine love and juſtice have eſpecially beene broken.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. If there ſhall bee a reſurrection of the body unto eternall life; then God may uſe His creature, man to His glory, as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Him: if not, then the power of God ſhall bee deſtitute of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, framed of body and ſoule, wich Hee may uſe to His glory. But this is impoſſible, that His power ſhould be deſtitute of ſuch a Creature to whom He hath promiſed immortall glory, therefore there ſhall bee a reſurrection unto everlaſting life.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. By how much any efficient is greater in power, by ſo much the more effectually doth it worke, that the effect bee brought to the beſt end, whereof it may be capable, and that eſpecially if the glory of the efficient be joyned therewith. The deſire and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt hope of every man is to live ever in body and ſoule, not parted aſunder, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4. and to this end and hope, God Himſelfe hath created us, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. and of this thing, every man is capable, and the great glory of the Creator ſhall bee moſt excelling in this, that He free His creature man from the baſeneſſe of mortality and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to an eſtate of Glory, and immortality: Therefore it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite that there bee a reſurrection, and life everlaſting: For He ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filleth the deſire of them that feare Him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.19. Therefore they ſhall riſe to life everlaſting.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. The will of man is created of God, that he may aſpire and come to that end, whereunto the goodneſſe and will of God have created him, which end hee cannot attaine unto, if there be no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and eternall life. For if there be no reſurrection, then is he created onely to the enjoying of happineſſe, ſhort and fading in this life, ſo ſhould he have the underſtanding and deſire of excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great ſelicitie, and the enjoying of little. But this is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, for ſo the effect, that is, the ſhort happineſſe, ſhould not bee anſwerable to the cauſe, that is, the will of God, which hath put this will and deſire of eternall happineſſe in man. But if the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall appetites of eating, drinking, procreation of the like, &amp;c. can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be in vaine, much leſſe, the ſpirituall deſires of knowing, of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:107656:207"/>God, and pleaſing of Him. But the firſt are not in vaine, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not the latter, though that be not firſt which is ſpirituall, but that which is naturall, and then that which is ſpirituall.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. Man as he is a creature of God, is good, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.31. and his goodneſſe is greater in reſpect of the end of his creation, which was to know, love, and honour God, which in this life hee cannot doe, becauſe of ſinne, the worke of the devill in him. But it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that either the ſinne of man, or the malice of the devill ſhould fruſtrate the end of God in His creation. Therefore there is a reſurrection, and eternall life, wherein God ſhall have His due from man, and man his eternall joy in God.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. No word or commandment of God can be in vaine, as that, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and Him onely ſhalt thou ſerve;</hi> or that; <hi>Thou ſhalt be perfect with the Lord thy God.</hi> For man doing thus, the ſoule ſhall be happie, and approach to that end, for which it was created. For therefore God loved man, that he might love and honour God againe; which becauſe it is not done in this life, becauſe of our infirmitie, and our ſinne, therefore there ſhall be a reſurrection, and life everlaſting, wherein our love ſhall be perfected, leaſt the divine love ſhould ſuffer eternall inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and eternall puniſhment be brought upon the creature, ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly beloved, and not returning that love againe.</p>

Man is the end of all bodily being, either in that he is the combination of all bodily beings, whether they be elementall, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable, and ſenſitive; and likewiſe of things that have imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and reaſon, <hi>See hereto, Chap.</hi> 17. §. 4. <hi>n.</hi> 5. or elſe becauſe all bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily beings ſhall have their reſt and perfection in him, and with him: or at leaſt becauſe he uſes theſe things to ſuch workes as are acceptable to God: But if there be no reſurrection, then after the end of this world, man in whom, and with whom, all theſe things are to receive their perfection, not being at all, all theſe things have no end of their being, and ſo either not being at all, or elſe being for no end, their creation (as concerning their uttermoſt and true end which is the eternall glory of God) ſhould bee in vaine, and that expectation or groaning of the creature to bee delivered from the bondage of corruption, of which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. ſhould alſo be in vaine, and the promiſe of making all things new, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.5. <hi>Eſ.</hi> 65.17. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.13. ſhould alſo bee of none effect.

Neither is the body, nor yet the ſoule for it ſelfe, but both the one and the other, that both together may make one perfect man: So the perfection and bleſſedneſſe of the whole man is more than that which can come onely to one part. But if there bee not a reſurrection of the body, this greater bleſſedneſſe is utterly loſt, ſo that although the ſoule bee happie for ever; yet the greater bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe of the ſoule and body together, ſuffers eternall privation.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:107656:208"/>So the whole ſhould be onely, that one part may bee happie: ſo the hope, even of the faithfull ſhould bee in vaine, and their eternall happineſſe onely in imperfection; and ſo the puniſhment of the wicked.

For every promiſe, and every threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning therein, brings you to this; that a reckoning muſt be given for all that which you have done in the body: For if the body, with the ſences, the ſervants of the ſoule, either for ſinne, or righteouſneſſe, ſhould not live againe, then the divine juſtice, in reward, and puniſhment, ſhould be defective, but this is impoſſible. The texts that are plaine you will underſtand by your ſelfe, as that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.3. <hi>Thou turneſt man to deſtruction, and ſayeſt, Returne ye children of men.</hi> Some are a little further off, which yet you may eaſily bring hither, as <hi>Eſay</hi> 38.18, 19. <hi>The grave cannot praiſe thee; They that goe downe into the pit cannot hope for thy trueth.

For ſeeing man was made to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie God in his body, and in his ſoule and that his end cannot bee fruſtrate; man muſt live againe, that his mercy and juſtice may be praiſed, both by the good, and the bad. <hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iambres</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood <hi>Moſes,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.8.

But concerning the being or ſubſtance of the fleſh, or body of man, ſeeing it was tempered by Gods owne hand, faſhioned according to His jmage, made the ſeat of the ſoule ſo excellent a being, by which and with which the ſoule workes whatſoever it doth; ſeeing in the holy Baptiſme, the fleſh is waſh't, that the ſoule may be cleane; ſeeing in the holy Supper, the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the mouth, that the ſoule may be ſtrengthened in God; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our bodies are the members of <hi>Christ,</hi> the temples of the <hi>Holy-Ghost,</hi> and He dwells in them; ſeeing our bodies are not our owne, but Gods, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. ſeeing they are the inſtruments of holineſſe, in all the workes of mercy, in prayers, in wholeſome counſell, almes deeds, in indurance of ſorrowes, in faſting, in impriſonment, in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome in death; it is impoſſible that God ſhould leave forlorne the workemanſhip of His owne hands, the cloſet of His owne breath, the maſterpiece of His cunning, the heire of His riches, and the Prieſt of His religion and ſervice, to dwell in eternall death; that He ſhould not heale the wounds, and reſtore thoſe dead to life, which have beene wounded and ſlaine for His ſake.

Therefore though this materiall, individuall body ſhall be raiſed up; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is raiſed up a in ſpiritual eſtate, it will be free from naturall corruption, becauſe it is fitted to be an eternall habitation for the ſoule, being wholly ſpirituall; and then there will be no want of any member or part, when the ſoule ſhall be able to fit it ſelfe of a clothing, for all uſes, out of a ſpirituall body; neither ſhall it need to ſeeke any ſupply out of a forreigne body: For as in juſtice the ſame ſoule muſt returne to the ſame body, that both may ſuffer, or be glorified together; So ſhall both be perfected together, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the perfection of every individuall, in their proper parts: And though they be ſcattered in aſhes, or duſt, as farre as from Eaſt to Weſt, yet ſhall every atome be gathered into that body in which it firſt received the impreſſion of an humane ſoule, to become a part of a reaſonable man.

                        <p>Among the <hi>Christians,</hi> ſome twenty ſects of Hereticks have beene, which denied this Article; ſome upon one ground, ſome up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another. The firſt fountaine of this poyſoned doctrine among the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> was <hi>Simon</hi> the <hi>Samaritane,</hi> whoſe Scholars held it ſucceſſively unto <hi>Marcus,</hi> about a 100. yeeres after <hi>Simon.</hi> This <hi>Marcus</hi> alſo upheld the ſame hereſie: but after him it was by turnes call'd up from hell againe. <hi>Carpocrates</hi> out of <hi>Platoes</hi> Schole, brought in the change of ſoules, from body to body: but much worſe than hee. For <hi>Plato</hi> thought that the ſoules of men were ſent into the bodies of beaſts, or of crazed and old men, for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their former ſinnes: but <hi>Carpocrates</hi> taught that they were brought thither for the fulfilling of thoſe luſts which they had not done in their former bodies. For being here ſubiect to the power of the enemie, man (ſaid hee) cannot eſcape the wrath of theſe adverſaries; but by the filthineſſe of life, and doing ſuch things as pleaſe them. And therefore the ſoules that live heere moſt vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and temperately, are ofteneſt ſent into other bodies. Though this doctrine of the devills Chaplaine, upheld the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the ſoule, yet no reſurrection of the body.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Valentine,</hi> and after him the <hi>Manichees,</hi> taught that the ſoules of men onely were redeemed by <hi>Christ,</hi> but not their bodies, and therefore they ſhould riſe no more. Neither yet ſhould all ſoules bee ſaved. For there bee (ſaid hee) three ſorts of men: ſpirituall, animall, and carnall. Spirituall, which by nature have a moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent faith, and theſe ſhall be ſaved without good workes, as <hi>Seth:</hi> Animal, which have but a little faith, but may bee ſaved by a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of their workes, as <hi>Abel.</hi> But the carnall as <hi>Cain,</hi> can by no meanes bee ſaved.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Marcion,</hi> concerning the reſurrection of the body, ſided with <hi>Valentine,</hi> And ſo did <hi>Apelles.</hi> For, (ſaid hee) <hi>Christ</hi> Himſelfe went to Heaven without any body. For that body which Hee had taken from Heaven, and the elements; at the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Hee delivered againe to their proper principles, from whence He tooke it.</p>
                        <pb n="194" facs="tcp:107656:211"/>
                        <p>The <hi>Seleucians</hi> alſo, that affirme that <hi>Chriſt</hi> left His body in the Sunne (as you read before) are bound to denie to us any aſcent into the heavens above: for it cannot be better with us the members, than it is with our Head.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Origens</hi> errour againſt the reſurrection, is at large refuted by <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphanius, Haer.</hi> 64. and if you minde the objections and anſweres before, you have the ſum of that which <hi>Origen</hi> brought againſt it, and the other anſwered.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Hierax</hi> denied a reſurrection of the body, but is diſproved by the arguments heere brought, as all the other Hereticks which are here mentioned. A reſurrection of the ſoule he yeelded unto, except of the Infants, which died before they had knowledge; becauſe none is crowned, except he that ſtrives lawfully, as you read before, in the 28. <hi>Chapter,</hi> where his reaſon is anſwered out of <hi>Epiphanius, Haer.</hi> 67.</p>
                        <p>And although you ſee ſuch monſters of opinions, as I have ſaid, and if you have leiſure, may read the refutation in particular, in the Authour aforeſaid; Yet if you take good heed to that which hath beene ſpoken for, and againſt the trueth; you may confeſſe that the trueth is great, and ſhall prevaile.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. XXXIX. <g ref="char:leaf">❧</g> And life everlaſting.</head>
                        <p>§ 1. <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hile there was no ſinne in the world, it ſtood not with the juſtice of God, that any puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſinne ſhould bee inflicted: therefore death, and all diſeaſes, as his fore-runners, with hunger, thirſt, and all the enemies of life, were far from man. But after that ſinne had brought in death, it was a mercy that all thoſe enemies of life, which accompanied death, ſhould ſhew themſelues, that man might daily be put in mind of his mortalitie, and returne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Him whom he had offended. Now if you ſhall aske from whence this change of eſtates, from immortality, to mortality, did ſucceed in man: I thinke even from hence, that the pure ſoule, the image of God, dwelling in the body, which was framed of the bodily crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which was yet pure, and not ſubjected to the curſe, had power to ſuſtaine the body in that perfect eſtate wherein it was created, and ſo ſhould have preſerved it for ever, if it had held that digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which it had, and hearkened onely to the ordinance of God,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:107656:211"/>and had reigned over the bodily affections and deſires, as it ought, and had power to doe. But when the ſoule would forſake God the guide thereof, and that dignitie which it had naturally over the body, and follow the luſts and appetites thereof, and for that trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt God, loſt the power and ſtrength which it had to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the body: and moreover muſt ſeeke ſuſtenance for the body out of the creature, now accurſed and deprived of her firſt ſtrength: it was impoſſible but that according to the curſe, corruption, diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and death ſhould follow thereupon. Yet ſeeing the merit of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſo ful of ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the juſtice of God, and He ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to reſtore all the decay of nature; and to deſtroy all the wrack and miſchiefe which the devill hath brought thereinto: wee may firmely beleeve as we profeſſe in this Article, that wee ſhall at laſt be brought to the enjoying of everlaſting life, better than that to which wee were at firſt created.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. For although by the craft of the devill, ſinne entered into the world, and death by ſinne paſſed over all man-kind: yet ſeeing man was made immortall, and that neither the end which God purpoſed, nor yet the infinite merit of the death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> can bee in vaine: it is impoſſible but that man-kind at laſt ſhould be brought to eternall life.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The infinite goodneſſe of God, is the reaſon and the cauſe that he is good to all, and that His mercy is over all His workes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.9. Therefore there is an eternall life reſerved for man the moſt excellent of the viſible creature, and the will of man above all other things, deſires an eternall life in glory and happineſſe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to His promiſes. But if no ſuch eternall life ſhall bee, then the action of God toward His creature, ſhall be in litleneſſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; neither ſhall he fulfill the deſire of them that feare Him. So alſo the will of man ſhould more deſire the accompliſhment of the divine goodnes upon the creature, than the will of God ſhould deſire the accompliſhment of it ſelfe. But theſe things are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible: therefore there ſhall bee an eternall life in glory and happineſſe.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Virtue, and the ready ſervice of man unto God, is that thing wherewith God in man is moſt delighted, and which He hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, as it is ſaid, <hi>Be ye holy, for I am holy, Lev.</hi> 11.44. and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of this holineſſe is found in them eſpecially, that hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſſe, and hate their ſinnes, whereby they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe Him. But this ſeruice of man to God, hath not hitherto beene duely performed by any living among the ſonnes of men, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can be performed, both in body and ſoule, by the dead. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſhall be performed in the life that is to come, wherein both Gods will, and the deſires of His ſhall bee fulfilled. <hi>See Matth.</hi> 5.6.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. If there ſhalbe an eternal life for man, then man ſhall receive of the divine goodneſſe and power, a power whereby he may both bee,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:107656:212"/>and doe thoſe things whereto the divine goodneſſe and wiſedome hath appointed him. But if there be no life eternall, then the end of mans creation ſhould be onely to privation, and not being. But it were better never to have beene, than after all the miſeries of this life, in the end to returne to an everlaſting not being. For ſo the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that is, man-kind, ſhould no way be anſwerable to the cauſe, nor yet be any proofe or manifeſtation, of that goodneſſe, infinity, eternitie, and power by which it was made. But this is impoſſible, and againſt the conditions both of the prime cauſe, and the infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the dignities thereof.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay, that this reaſon doth no more prove that there is an eternall life for man, than for beaſts, and other of the creatures, which alſo ought to continue for the proofe of that wiſedome, and almightyneſſe of their cauſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſwere.</hi> There is a difference betweene the end, and thoſe things which are for the end. Man is the end of all the viſible crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and therefore it followes, that all thoſe things are to bee in man, as in the end, ſo far forth as they can be, worke, or be glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Him. And from hence alſo it followeth, that man muſt bee for ever, leſt all theſe things which were for him, ſhould returne to nothing with him; and the image of that infinite goodneſſe, and wiſedome by which they were made, ſhould come to nothing eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally. Therefore though they ſhall be in man as the <hi>idéa</hi> of them all, yet not in their ſeverall or diſtinct beings beſide man.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. No naturall deſire of the creature, which is implanted in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry individuall, of every kind, can bee in vaine, becauſe it is implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therein by a ſuperiour power, which cannot bee fruſtrate. But it is implanted in all men naturally, both to deſire, and to hope for eternall life. Therefore there ſhalbe an eternall life. For if after the reſurrection, man ſhould not live for ever, then there ſhould be in God a will to raiſe him to life; contrary to his will, that hee ſhould live for ever: So His being ſhould not be ſimple, and one: but this is impoſſible, as it was proved, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. §. 6.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. The more powerfull that any cauſe is, the more manifeſtly doth the likeneſſe thereof appeare in the effect. And ſith God is the firſt and chiefe cauſe of all, and that the likeneſſe of man, His worke ſhall be greater in his perpetuall well-being, than in not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at all: therefore there ſhall bee an eternall life, wherein the greateſt likeneſſe of the effect to the cauſe ſhall be perfected, that man may live in eternall Righteouſneſſe, Wiſedome, and Glory. Otherwiſe the infinite juſtice might ſeeme defective, in reward and puniſhment, if both good and bad ſhould periſh alike. Moreover, the word whereby the puniſhment was inflicted, was neither ſo generall, nor ſo without exception, but that there was grace reſerved. And now, leſt he take of the tree of life, and live for ever [in his ſin] therefore the Lord God ſent him forth of the garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> the type of eternall happineſſe, till he had taſted of death, the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:107656:212"/>puniſhment of his ſinne, then ſhould hee live for ever in joy.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. And theſe reaſons for the aſſurance of everlaſting life, you may adde to them that are in the Chapter before. And above all reaſon, the holy promiſes of God which cannot faile; as <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that He gave His onely begotten Sonne, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever beleeveth in Him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life. Titus</hi> 3.7. <hi>Wee are made heires according to the hope of everlaſting life. Matth.</hi> 19.29. <hi>Every one that hath forſaken houſes, &amp;c. or lands for my ſake, ſhall receive an hundred fold, and ſhall inherit everlaſting life. Pſal.</hi> 37.18. <hi>The Lord knoweth the dayes of the upright, that their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance ſhall be for ever. Pſalm.</hi> 23. <hi>I ſhall dwell in the houſe of the Lord for ever.</hi> And that the ioyes of heaven are eternall, it may appeare by the torments of the wicked that are in hell: of both which ſee <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. from <hi>verſ.</hi> 31. to 46. And therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle concludes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. <hi>That the afflictions which are of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent life, are not worthy to be compared with the glory that ſhall bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed. For thoſe things which God hath prepared for them that love Him, are ſuch as neither eye hath ſeene, nor eare hath heard, neither have they entred into the heart of man to conceive,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the aſſurance of this joy, let the ſame mind be in us which was in Saint <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 8.38, 39. <hi>I am perſwaded, that neither death nor life, nor Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Ieſus our Lord.</hi> For it is juſt with God, to give unto His Sonne, having fully ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied His juſtice for the ſinne of man; to give to His Sonne, I ſay, according to the merit of His deſert, that glory, and honour, and immortall joy, which is due to Him therefore: which joy, for the infinite merit of His Perſon, being both God and man, muſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be infinite. And becauſe Himſelfe is God bleſſed for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more and hath eternall glory and happineſſe, and a Name which is above every name that is named in this world, or in the world to come; therefore hath Hee not any need of this purchaſed glory which is due for His ſufferings; but that glory is reſerved for them that are called of His grace, to be partakers thereof. And becauſe a finite creature cannot be capable of infinite glory at once, <hi>inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſivè,</hi> that is, according to the infinite meaſure thereof; therefore is it beſtowed, <hi>extenſivè,</hi> that is, in the externity or continuance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, wherein man is carryed from glory to glory, by the Spirit of the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. Neither is it for any man to thinke, that this glory which <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath purchaſed by His obedience, ſhould be ſetled on that humane nature which He aſſumed in the Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For that hereditary, or native glory, which He had, as being one with the Father, was abundantly ſufficient to glorifie that taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle whereſoever He was pleaſed to dwell, as He ſaith, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.5. <hi>And now, ô Father, glorifie thou Me with thine owne ſelfe, with that glory which I had with thee before this world was.</hi> So it appearing, both by
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:107656:213"/>reaſon and authority of the holy Scripture, that this happineſſe which we doe beleeve in eternall life, is to be eternall as the life is; that firſt doubt which was firſt<note n="*" place="margin">In the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance before Chapter 1.</note> propoſed in the entrance, is fully ſatisfied. The other two queſtions, concerning the ſoule, you ſhall heare by and by.</p>
                        <p>§ 2. The hereſies that have been concerning this Article, though they be divers, yet two eſpecially are needfull to be examined: One of the <hi>Chiliaſts,</hi> which thought, that after the reſurrection, the kingdome of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was to flouriſh 1000. yeeres in this world: ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that Scripture which is in <hi>Revel.</hi> 20. for proofe thereof. The other is that which they lay to St. <hi>Origen.</hi> That all the reaſonable creature, even the moſt wicked among men; yea, the very devills themſelves, after their ſins, by long torments, have been purged out, ſhall be reſtored to joy and happines in the kingdome of heaven; and againe after a long time, ſhall fall to their former ſins againe, and ſo returne to their ancient puniſhment: and this, ſay they, ſhall be the revolution of all the reaſonable creature, both good and bad, for ever. 1. But this is contrary to the trueth of the holy Scripture. For no creature, either man or Angel, can approach to God, or come to heavenly happines, but onely ſuch as God doth love, <hi>and whom He loves, He loves unto the end: Iohn</hi> 13.1. <hi>becauſe in Him is neither va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riableneſſe, nor ſhadow of change. Iam.</hi> 1.17. 2. Moreover, as none can be partaker of heavenly joyes, but ſuch as are intereſted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by <hi>Christ;</hi> ſeeing <hi>no man commeth to the Father, but by Him. Ioh.</hi> 14.6. if there ſhould be any falling from joy, it would ſeeme to argue an inſufficiency of the merit of <hi>Christ,</hi> which cannot ſtand with the infinity thereof. 3. Beſides, if God willed this eternall revolution of the creature, from extreame joy to paine, and from paine to joy; then were we not taken into the ſtate of ſonnes and heirs of glory, <hi>yea, coheirs with Ieſus Christ. Ro.</hi> 8.17. but to the ſtate of bondmen, which ſhould have ſo much happines, as we were able to purchaſe by our indurance of afflictions and torments. 4. So the juſtice of God ſhould not be infinite, if it might be ſatisfied by a finite creature. 5. And if any ſatisfaction to God could have bin made, beſide that which was by the death of <hi>Christ,</hi> then that of <hi>Christ</hi> had beene needleſſe and in vaine. But all theſe thins are impoſſibilities. Therefore there is no ſuch revolution from one ſtate to another, as this opinion, fained to <hi>Origen</hi> after his death, when hee could not anſwer for himſelfe, would bring in. But though <hi>Origen</hi> were a Saint, yet was he a man, and ſo might have his errours.</p>

                              <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not the doubt that any Chriſtian can make, whether the ſoule of man be immortall, or no. For when God hath come downe from heaven, and hath taken upon Himſelfe, the being of man; when He hath beene borne, and died to make ſatisfaction for the ſinne of man; can any one that beleeves this, make a doubt whether hee have an immortall ſoule? or whether immortall life doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to him both in ſoule and body? Therefore is not this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on propoſed for the Chriſtians ſake, but by way of defiance againſt the <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> and ſuch godleſſe people as ſay in their hearts; <hi>There is no God, no ſoule, no life to come.</hi> And although by all the arguments of the two laſt Chapters, and many before, the queſtion may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an eaſie ſolution; yet to give full ſatisfaction, is this which
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:107656:214"/>followes in particular. But to brand both the queſtions, and the movers thereof, with their due infamy, it muſt ever be remembred that the errour of the mortality of the ſoule, doth take away the foundation of all religion, and common honeſty: For how can he make due reckoning of honeſty, that cares onely for himſelfe, to ſhift and ſharke for a preſent maintenance in worldly plenty, and ſuppoſed joy, and thinkes that all is ended with him in this life? Or what reverence can he have of God, or His ſeruice, who is not perſwaded that there is a God? or if that muſt needs be put, yet is he perſwaded, that with this life ended, his foule alſo comes to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.

But theſe things are impoſſible for thee to ſuppoſe, that God ſhould be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unjuſt, or unwiſe. For perfect juſtice, ſuch as the infinite ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God is, doth ever bring foorth a judgement; in which it muſt appeare, that in Him that is infinitely juſt, there was neither ignorance of the ſervice done unto him, nor any diſability to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it: which becauſe it appeares not in this life, certainely it muſt be manifeſted hereafter. Therefore the ſoule is immortall.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Seeing all the world cannot affoord that which may give a full content unto the ſoule that judges rightly of every thing: See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we are taught, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.15. <hi>not to love this world, neither the things of this world;</hi> it is manifeſt, that the true happineſſe of the ſoule ought not to be ſought here among thoſe things that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour, and below the dignity and ſtate of the ſoule, which can be bleſſed onely in the ſight of God, as our Lord hath taught us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.8. Therefore the elect of God, which according to His coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and command, ſeeke true happineſſe in another life, ſhall in another life be ſure to find it. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.17.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. The working of the ſoule cannot be hindered by the body: not onely the ſpirituall actions of the underſtanding, and motion of the will; but even the actions of the ſoule upon the body, (as I have ſomewhere given inſtance, in the beating of the pulſe) and whatſoever hath motion of it owne nature, cannot be hindred to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that end whereto nature drives it, and the thing it ſelfe deſires to come (as the continuance and perfection of it ſelfe) becauſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth not worke in vaine, and the ſoule doth naturally deſire true happineſſe; that is, ſpirituall, eternall, and beſeeming the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it ſelfe. Therefore the ſoule is immortall.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. No ſubſtance which is intellectuall, is corruptible. For cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in ſubſtances, comes onely by the ſeparation of the matier, and eſſentiall forme: And becauſe beings intellectuall, that is, ſuch as have power of an active underſtanding, doe not conſiſt of matier,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:107656:214"/>but are of themſelues pure formes, therefore they are not ſubject to corruption, and death, properly ſo called. And although the ſoule, beſide the power of underſtanding, have alſo the power of growth, and ſences, as the naturall faculties thereof, by which it doth enlive mans body to move, to digeſt, to ſee, heare, feele, &amp;c. and that when it goes away from the body, theſe faculties of the ſoule forſake the body, yet they die not in the ſoule, but ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live the body in the reſurrection, as they did before: ſo that the ſoule is no way mortall.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Common conſent of all Nations, both <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> hold, and ever have held the immortality of the ſoule, and the ſoule it ſelfe beares witnes thereunto, which at the ſight of grievous ſinnes committed, findes ſuch terrours and affrightings in it ſelfe, as are ſometimes more fearefull than death. But if the ſoules of men did not live after the body, what cauſe had guilty minded men, either to feare death, or any torments that could fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after it?</p>
                           <p n="6">6. The excellent endowments of the ſoule, the engines, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious artes that are invented, the ſearch of the heavens motions, and the inuention of trueth in things removed from our ſences, yea, even concerning the truth of God, are arguments ſufficient of the ſoules immortality.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. And beſide theſe reaſons, the infallible authority of the Holy Scriptures ought towring this confeſſion even from the very Atheiſt. For the ſoule being breathed into man by an immortall principle, by the breath of God Himſelfe, may not bee ſuppoſed to bee corruptible: for ſo how could a thing mortall or corruptible be the image of the immortall God? <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26, 27. yet ſay I not as the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> or <hi>Priſcillianiſts,</hi> that the ſoule is of the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or ſubſtance with God, but that being ſo created by Him, and His image, it cannot be mortall, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.28. <hi>Feare not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the ſoule, but rather feare Him which is able to deſtroy both ſoule and body in hell.</hi> The parable of the rich glutton, and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> in <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. ſhew, the immortality, and ſtate of the ſoule, both of the good and bad.

                           <p> 1. BY ſome of the reaſons before, and by all the authorities brought out of the holy Writ, it is manifeſt, that this fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie of one common ſoule in all Men, was but a dreame of <hi>Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes.</hi> For if the humane ſoule be the proper forme of the body, and the ſpecifick difference of every ſubject, be by the forme thereof: If
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:107656:215"/>there be one common ſoule of all men, then the eſſential difference of men is taken away: ſo that they bee not now this man, and that man, but all men muſt be one man, as concerning their internall forms, the difference of men muſt be in their heccieties, or numerall diverſitie of their bodies onely. 2. But ſo the underſtanding and knowledge of all men ſhould bee one and the ſame, and one man ſhould not bee wiſe, and another fooliſh, but all men wiſe, or foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh alike, if there were onely one ſoule or underſtanding of all men. 3. So alſo the vice of one man ſhould multiplie it ſelfe over all men. 4. And all men ſhould have equall joy in the end or happines of any one man. But theſe things are not ſo. And as theſe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences proove the differences of ſoules, while they are in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of men: So likewiſe doe they withſtand that confuſion which would bee of the ſoules of men, being departed out of their bodies, which are not ſuppoſed to fall into the <hi>Chaos</hi> of life, and there to be confuſed as a drop of water falling into a River. For the ſoules being ſeparate from the bodies, have their ſeverall degrees of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, whereby they are diſtinguiſhed, as 2. from 3. ſo as they cannot be the ſame, as 2. cannot bee 3. 5. Moreover, both that unitie, and this confuſion of ſoules, would utterly take away all juſtice in reward and puniſhment of their deeds, which they have done well or ill, in this life.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. The uttermoſt happineſſe of man, is the adequation of all his faculties in that which is the perfection of goodneſſe, that is, that he love that which hee underſtands, and that he have power to performe it: for otherwiſe, his underſtanding would bee the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of paine and ſorrow unto him, if he ſhould know that which were good to be done, and ſhould not have power to effect it. But if there were a confuſion of all ſoules, or their underſtandings, when they are ſeparate from the body, that univerſall unitie, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of ſoules, would cauſe a leſneſſe, or abatement in the glory, and end of the underſtanding, and conſequently, an abatement of mans love to the Creator, ſeeing the greateſt underſtanding could not aduance the meane and low underſtanding of fooles and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants; but contrariwiſe in that confuſion, ſhould by them be aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. But this is contrary to the nature of the underſtanding, of the will, of perfect love, &amp;c. Therefore impoſſible to bee.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. The excellency, or greatneſſe of every thing hath the greateſt concordance with being, as the littleneſſe, or meannes of being, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines to not being, and hath ſome agreement there-with. From whence it will follow of neceſſitie, firſt, that if there bee one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or univerſall ſoule or underſtanding, which is divideable into very man, this diviſion takes away that univerſall unitie. For how can it be one in number, if it be diviſible, &amp; yet not materiall, or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily? but that excellencie which is in the common ſoule, by that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite diviſion among ſo many millions of men, is brought almoſt to not being. Secondly, there muſt be different underſtandings of
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:107656:215"/>all men, both living and dead, that the excellencie of all trueth may find ſome underſtandings, by which it may bee apprehended. 3. Seeing nothing is truely beloved, which is not firſt knowne or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; the love, and that underſtanding which man hath of God by this diviſion, ſuffers ſuch detriment as cannot bee made up againe. For the ſoule being parted among all men alike, one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not love nor underſtand more than another: So neither the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of one man can be more than another, nor the glory or happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of one man more than another.</p>

Firſt, that the ſoules of men are materiall formes; for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular being of every thing depends upon that from whence it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the individuation: So that the ſoule of man, depending on the body, and having the originall of the particular being from the body, either it dies with the body, as the ſoule of the beaſt: or if it remaine after the body, yet ſeeing it receives the particular being from the body, when it is parted from the body, it muſt run into the common Chaos of life: ſeeing that whereby the diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was made (that is, the particular bodies) are now taken away.</p>

                              <hi>Anſwere.</hi> The ſuppoſitions of this objection, that the difference of mens ſoules is onely in number, or depending upon the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar individuation of their bodies, are falſe. For the particular en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments of every ſoule, make ſuch differences as is fit to bee in ſoules, as I gave inſtance before in numbers: to every one of which, an unity added, or taken away, makes the number ſo different, as that it cannot be any other number than that it is; Although num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are not truely ſaid to bee different <hi>Species,</hi> but onely to bee diſtinct, or divers individuals. For in Spirituall ſubſtances, as the ſoule of man is, whereof wee know ſo little as wee doe, wee muſt be content to hold the generall trueths, when we cannot know the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular or preciſe differences.</p>

But concerning the <hi>Iewes,</hi> though it muſt bee yeelded unto them, that they were the true Church, firſt called and ſeparated from the world, to be a peculiar people unto God; who firſt received the covenant of Circumciſion, and after under <hi>Moſes,</hi> the other cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, even untill the time of reformation came by <hi>Ieſus Christ:</hi> yet becauſe they did not looke unto the end of the law, nor ſee how all the law was finiſhed in Him, in whom all the Nations of the earth were to be bleſſed: therefore they dwell ſtill in their old and beggerly rudiments, being ſtill ſeduced by their Rabbins, teaching them that their law is an eternall law, as it is yeelded unto them, concerning the inward meaning or ſubſtance, that is <hi>Christ,</hi> and His eternall Redemption: But concerning the outward obſeruances, the Law is not eternall, as divers of their owne, both by Nation, and ſometimes by opinion have manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them. I name unto you onely <hi>Paulus Ricius,</hi> who hath made it plaine, both by the Scriptures of the Prophets, and and by the <hi>Talmudiſts</hi> their expoſitors in his ſecond booke <hi>de coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti agricultura.</hi> That the rootes (as they call them) or Articles of the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> faith, are not a ſufficient direction to bring them to heaven: but that the <hi>Christians</hi> by their faith may bee made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the ioyes to come.

That the myſterie of the incarnation, and the deitie of the Saviour of the world is according to the Scripture. 3. That

                           <p> SO precious is the redemption of ſoules, that that muſt bee let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone to God for ever. And therefore no workes, or merit of our owne, nor of all the Saints of Heaven, can be of any availe for us, that wee ſhould be accounted juſt before God, but onely by our Lord <hi>Ieſus,</hi> and His righteouſneſſe, both originall, and actuall, apprehended by a true faith, are wee accepted righteous. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God doth not accept of any righteouſneſſe which is not moſt perfect, according to the perfection of his moſt juſt law: And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fountaine of all our actions is corrupted by our originall ſinne: therefore is the originall righteouſneſſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be imputed unto us, to take away our originall ſinne, and His actuall righteouſneſſe alſo wholly neceſſary, that by His obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and His ſufferings, wee may bee juſtified: Vnderſtand by the originall righteouſneſſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> not that righteouſneſſe which is in Him as God (as ſome have done) but that righteouſneſſe which was in Him, as man, from the firſt minute of His incarnation by the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> which is His originall, or habituall righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: And this righteouſneſſe of His, though it bee not in us; yet it is imputed unto us, even as our originall and actuall ſinnes, were imputed unto Him, that wee might bee juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Him. And although it be neceſſary for us to know and to beleeve, that as wee are made originally ſinfull by <hi>Adam,</hi> not onely becauſe the offence of him that was the father of us all, is imputed unto us, or is reckoned ours, becauſe wee were all in him originally; but alſo in reſpect of that ſtaine of ſinne and corruption, which wee draw originally from him; ſo is this righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of <hi>Christ</hi> accounted ours, in as much as He hath ſet Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to anſwere for us, as it is ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.28. <hi>That Hee gave His life a ranſome for many, that as by the diſobedience of one</hi> Adam,

                              <hi>many are made ſinners, ſo by the obedience of One, that is Chriſt, many are justified, Rom.</hi> 5.19. Therefore faith alone is not ſaid to juſtifie us, but faith with the object thereof, that is, <hi>Christ</hi> with all His merits. So God the Father, for the merit of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is ſaid to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the ungodly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5.

Neither is faith any meritorious cauſe for which we are juſtified: neither doeth faith, preciſely conſidered, include charity or other vertues, thereby juſtifie us; but as an inſtrument, or hand, is it given to us of God, whereby we take hold on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and His righteouſneſſe preached unto us in the word of reconciliation. Therefore as the hand which receiues the treaſure, doth not make a man rich, but the treaſure it ſelfe: So neither the habit, nor the action of faith, no not as it is the worke of God in us, doth make us juſt before Him; but onely correlatively, that is, as it brings to us the merit of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and makes it ours.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ecauſe I had both read and heard, that divers men of fame in learning had undertaken this taske which I have now performed (as you ſee) I waited with great patience and hope the accompliſhment of their promiſes. But when they were dead, and no fruites appeared, worthy of ſuch hopes as they had given, having now paſt the ſeventieth yere of my life, I utterly deſpaired of what I had ſo long hoped for. For though I had often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thought of that argument, and for mine owne uſe had gathered di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Notes and Arguments thereunto: yet when I conſidered, that in that age the vigor of wit doth often languiſh, which in younger yeares is more pregnant, though not alwayes with that ſtaydnes of judgment, which ought to goe therewith; and eſpecially, that for my profeſsions ſake, I was compelled to <hi>poëts</hi> and their fables; and among children, to ſpeake to their underſtanding; yet when that great and grievous peſtilence, which befell in the yeare <hi>1625.</hi> had made a ſtop to that dayly toyle, I knew it was fooliſh and altogether vaine, to flee from the hand of God; and that no thoughts could befit a Chriſtian better, in the continuall hearing of dolefull knells, and ſight of corpſes carryed to the grave, then ſuch as hold the mynd faſt to God, and thoſe bleſſed hopes, that He hath given to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian men. And therefore hauing brought my houſhold to a few, and them no gadders abroad, but ſuch as were eaſily commanded to ſtay within; I tooke the comforts, which Almighty God vouchſafed mee, and found my ſelfe ſafe under His protection; and ſo cheerefully undertooke that taske, which I had long thought on, becauſe my expectation of others had quite failed me. Therefore I praiſe and magnifie that glorious and holy Name, not only for that whole and perfect deliverance, which He vouchſafed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mee at that time, but much more alſo, that Hee hath beene pleaſed to effect by me, ſo meane, that which other vertuous and learned men held fit to be done for the benefit of the Church; and yet effected it not. And if this labor of mine may prove any way availeable to the comfort of others, or the ſtrengthening of their faith, or eſtabliſhing of them therein; that they fall not into thoſe hereſies, into which other peruerſe minded men have beene plunged: For this alſo ſhall His praiſe be ever in my mouth, according to that example of the holy Angels, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hile I was at <hi>Norwich,</hi> in the yeere <hi>1597,</hi> I writ this Treatiſe vpon ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion as appeares therein, and delivered it unto that Hereticke, that by himſelfe, if <hi>God</hi> would, he might conſider and be perſwaded. Since which time I have kept it by me: and though ſome of my private friends deſired copies; yet allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that wiſedome of <hi>Solon,</hi> who would make no law againſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricide, leſt the mention of the fact might give occaſion to commit it: and withall conſidering that it is too ſimple and poore for the publike view; I refuſed to make it common.

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:107656:220"/>but onely the racke of authorities to conſtraine him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it; may perhaps bee hereby ſatisfied and finde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: and that they who are already ſtrong, may by this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus, triumph in the goodneſſe of <hi>God,</hi> who requires them to beleeve no more, then they may by that underſtanding, which hee hath given them, bee perſwaded of: I have for their ſakes who may reape benefit thereby, neglected all froward Cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, not guilty unto my ſelfe of any offence which I can commit in making it publike.

                  <head>THE TREATISE.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough many things diſcouraged mee to write unto you of this Argument in ſuch ſort as I intend; conſidering that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your daily reading of the Scripture, neither the perſwaſion of learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines can moove you to accord unto the truth; though by manifeſt teſtimony of Scripture they conuince your hereſie: and moſt of all, that God hath left you to beleeve <hi>that lying ſpirit of Antichriſt, who denyeth that</hi> Ieſus <hi>is that</hi> Chriſt: Yet nevertheleſſe, having ſome hope that <hi>God</hi> of His goodneſſe will at laſt pull you as a brand out of the fire, and quench you with the dew of His grace, that you may grow in the knowledge of His <hi>Sonne;</hi> I will as briefly as I can, lay downe ſome few reaſons of that faith, which every one that will be ſaved, muſt hold. Whereby if I perſwade you nothing, yet ſhall I obtain thus much; that you, who neither beleeved His word, nor yet opened your eyes to ſee the light of reaſonable underſtanding, ſhall at laſt confeſſe, that His word and judgments are <hi>holy and true.</hi> But before I come to the point, let me firſt perſwade you, that although the knowledge of the holy <hi>Trinity</hi> be one of the moſt high myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which can be knowne or beleeved, and that it is the only worke of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> to worke this faith and knowledge in the heart of man; yet nevertheleſſe, <hi>God</hi> hath not left us deſtitute of meanes, whereby to come to this faith and knowledge, but hath alſo with His word, given us a reaſonable ſoule and underſtanding, whereby to grow in the knowledge of Himſelfe and His will. For when <hi>Adam</hi> was created, he had given unto him all perfect knowledge meete for him. Now <hi>God,</hi> who created the world for no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, then the manifeſtation of His owne glory, might not leave that creature without underſtanding of the <hi>Godhead,</hi> who being by nature and creation the moſt excellent in this viſible world, was made for that purpoſe eſpecially above all other, to ſet foorth His praiſe, and to call on Him. Now how could he doe this, if he knew Him not? But (I thinke that) ſeeing it is ſaid, that <hi>man was created in the jmage of God,</hi> you will not deny that man before his fall, had
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:107656:221"/>much more perfect underſtanding of the <hi>Godhead,</hi> then it is poſſible for him to have, <hi>till he come to know even as he is known,</hi> but that by ſin (you may ſay) this knowledge was loſt: not loſt, but corrupted only, even as mans will. For then it ſhould follow that we were inferior to bruit beaſts, who have in them a ſenſible knowledge meete for that end whereto they were created. Furthermore, it is not poſſible that mans ſinne ſhould fruſtrate the end, which <hi>God</hi> intended in His creation; but it is manifeſt, that man was created to know and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Creator. Againe, ſeeing <hi>in Chriſt all things conſiſt,</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ordained of the Father before all worlds, in whom the world ſhould be both created and reſtored; It is plaine that this light of our underſtanding both proceedeth from Him, and is reſtored in Him, as it is ſaid, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. <hi>He is that light that lightneth euery man that cometh into the world,</hi> not onely His choſen with knowledge of His ſaving trueth, but even generally every man with reaſonable underſtanding, whereby we may know <hi>whatſoever is to bee knowne of God:</hi> and how? even by the workes of <hi>God,</hi> as it is plainely conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Rom.</hi> 1, 19, 20. Therefore are they not to bee heard, who hold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing without the compaſſe of <hi>Faith,</hi> which is without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of <hi>Knowledge.</hi> For Faith ought ſo to be grounded on Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as Hope is grounded upon Faith. So that as Faith, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.1. is ſaid to bee <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>an eviction or proofe of things hoped for, though they be not ſeene:</hi> ſo may I ſay, that Knowledge is the proofe of things, which are beleeved. For Faith is nothing elſe but the Concluſion of a particular Syllogiſme, drawne from the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of an univerſall, which the knowledge of <hi>God</hi> had concluded, as it is manifeſt, <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.19. and <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.3. By conference of which two places it appeareth, that this knowledge, of which I ſpeake, this Hiſtoricall Faith, as to beleeve that there is one <hi>God,</hi> which made all things of nought, is onely ſuch a knowledge, as the devils, and wicked men have: but to beleeve, and have confidence in this <hi>God,</hi> is that particular concluſion, and that faith which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth us to have hope in His promiſes. Therefore ſaid <hi>Christ, Have Faith in God:</hi> that is, ſtrive to know <hi>God,</hi> that knowing, you may have faith, and beleeve in Him. And wee ſee that in theſe things, where a bare faith without knowledge might ſeeme to be moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, becauſe (as a man would thinke) there were no reaſon to be given of them, namely, concerning the maintenance of this life, and the reſurrection to the life to come; both <hi>Christ</hi> and His Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles uſe no other reaſons, but ſuch as every reaſonable man may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily bee perſwaded by, though authorities of Scripture were not wanting to both purpoſes, as it is manifeſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. and 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. Yea, <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> or whereſoever hee perſwaded the worſhip of the true <hi>God</hi> among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> hee perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not by authoritie of Scripture, which amongſt them had beene very weake; but by ſuch arguments as they knew to bee ſufficient even in themſelues. If theſe things were not ſo; how
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:107656:221"/>then could <hi>the Gentiles, which knew not the Scriptures, be without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe</hi> for their ignorance of <hi>God?</hi> Therefore I conclude, that there is nothing which is beleeved, but it may alſo be knowen. Now know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge (we know) is ingendered by ſuch principles as have trueth in them, the which is evident of it ſelfe. So that by plaine and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able underſtanding, a man may know whatſoever he beleeveth. You will ſay, To what purpoſe then ſerue the Scriptures? I anſwere: That <hi>God,</hi> infinite in goodneſſe, hath together with this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and light of Nature, given us withall His Word, as a greater light, whereby our leſſer lights might become more ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: That He hath given unto us not onely an inward Word, to wit, our naturall underſtanding; but alſo an outward word, as a moſt illuſtrious Commentary, both of declaration and amplificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that text, whereby we may the better underſtand, whatſoever wee ought to underſtand without it. But how then cometh it to paſſe, that all men have not Faith? And how is <hi>Faith</hi> ſaid to bee <hi>the gift of God?</hi> The firſt anſwered, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21. and <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4.18. <hi>For hardneſſe of their heart, who when they knew God, did not glorifie him as they ought: therefore their imaginations became vaine, and their fooliſh heart was full of darkneſſe.</hi> And for this cauſe is Faith alſo ſaid to bee the gift of <hi>God.</hi> Firſt, in reſpect of that knowledge whence it doth proceed, which knowledge is His gift. Secondly, becauſe it is the onely worke of <hi>God,</hi> to make that knowledge to become fruitfull, by laying it ſo unto mans heart, that the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof may be removed, that when wee know <hi>God</hi> to bee good and juſt, wee alſo beleeve and worſhip Him as wee ought. Thirdly, and moſt eſpecially, becauſe that <hi>God</hi> oftentimes pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ignorance, which men have of Himſelfe and the creature, doth ſo enlighten the heart with His <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> that it is ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly framed without any previant knowledge, to faith and obedience. The trueth whereof nevertheleſſe doth not any whit impugne that which I ſay; <hi>That God hath given unto every man ſo much underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as to know what he ought to beleeve, and to be ſatisfied for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of his Faith, if he could open his eyes to ſee in the middeſt of what wondrous light he were placed.</hi> This point is manifeſt both by many Scripture-authorities, and by many reaſons, which I omitt. But taking this as either granted, or ſufficiently prooved, that <hi>God hath given us light of underſtanding, whereby to yeeld a reaſon of the Hope that is in us;</hi> a reaſon, I ſay, even of every Article of our Faith: let us with holy reverence come unto the thing in queſtion, and ſee what reaſon wee have for our defence. I will therefore a while for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to uſe the authoritie of holy Scripture; not that I eſteeme the waight or evidence of any reaſon comparable thereto: but onely perceiving by that talk I had with you, that you had read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as one of thoſe, whom <hi>Peter</hi> noteth, 2. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 3.16. Not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to wrangle about your wreſted interpretations, I will firſt propoſe the evidence of reaſonable proofe: and afterwards bring in
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:107656:222"/>the aſſent of holy Scripture, that you may perceive in what wondrous cleare light you ſtrive to bee blinde. And becauſe I know not what your opinion is concerning <hi>God,</hi> (for he that deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the <hi>God-head of Chriſt,</hi> may as well denie the <hi>God-head</hi> abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:) that being one ſtep toward the queſtion, I will proceed or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, and give you alſo a reaſon of our faith, concerning that mati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: taking this onely as granted, which is rife in every mans know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that both the termes of Contradiction cannot bee affirmed of the ſame ſubject: that is, that one and the ſame thing cannot be both affirmed and denied, of the ſame ſubject, at one time, and in the ſame reſpect.</p>
                  <p>But firſt, by the name of <hi>God,</hi> know that I meane an <hi>Eternall Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, infinite in goodneſſe, in power, in wiſedome, in glorie, in vertue, and onely worthy of endleſſe love and honour.</hi> My reaſon is thus. If there be not a Being, which had no beginning; then of neceſſitie, that which was firſt exiſtent or begun, muſt be a beginning unto it ſelfe, by cauſing of it ſelfe to be, when it was not. But this is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that any thing ſhould be a cauſe, and not be: for ſo ſhould it both be, and not be; therefore there is an eternall Being, which is the beginning, middle, and end of all things, and Himſelfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beginning, and this eternall Being, wee call <hi>God.</hi> My reaſon is plaine to bee underſtood; and remember what I have ſaid, that I may goe on.</p>
                  <p>Whatſoever is without beginning, is alſo without ending; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath no Superiour, which might bring it to nothing: therefore <hi>God is eternall.</hi> Againe, whatſoever comes to nothing, is corrupted by his contrarie; but nothing can be oppoſite to <hi>God,</hi> therefore He is Eternall. Or elſe I might thus reaſon.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Being, and Not-being are ſuch contraries, as one of them can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſpring out of another: for every thing, for the preſervations ſake of it ſelfe, doth repreſſe and corrupt the contrarie. Seeing then that there is Being, which could not poſſibly raiſe it ſelfe out of Not-Being; it followes that Being had a primacy or priority before Not-Being; and therefore of neceſſitie muſt be eternall: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there was a time, wherein it might be ſaid, that Being is not Being, and ſo Not-Being ſhould have beene firſt, and contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries might have ſtood together: but both theſe are impoſſible; therefore there is an eternall Being; and this eternall Being, wee call <hi>God.</hi> Furthermore wee know, that the greateſt excellency or perfection of every thing, is in the neareneſſe, or likeneſſe thereof unto the firſt cauſe. But every thing is more excellent in the Being therof, then in the Not-Being: Therefore Being was before Not-Being; and for that cauſe, Eternall. Now Eternitie is an infinite Continuance: Therfore whatſoever is Eternall, muſt of neceſſitie be Infinite: and this Infinite being, we call <hi>God.</hi> Moreover, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hath Infinite continuance, hath Infinite Power to continue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely; and this omnipotent or endleſſe power, we call <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:107656:222"/>
                  <p>I might reaſon likewiſe of His <hi>Goodneſſe,</hi> of His <hi>Wiſedome, Truth, Glory, &amp;c.</hi> But one ſhall ſerue in ſtead of the reſt, and I will take His Wiſedome for my example, and prove unto you, that likewiſe to be Infinite, and that not onely in exiſtence, but in action alſo. And firſt that hee is wiſe; <hi>God</hi> is moſt worthy to be ſuch as He is: but if He were not wiſe, He were not worthy to bee <hi>God: Ergo</hi> he is wiſe. Now marke how theſe depend one on another. In <hi>God</hi> is Wiſedome, which by reaſon of His Infinitie, is alſo Infinite: and by His Eternitie, is alſo Eternall: ſo that there is no time, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it may be ſaid, that this infinite Wiſedome is not infinitely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, for then were it not eternally infinite. Therefore His wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is infinite, not in exiſtence onely, but alſo in action.</p>
                  <p>Againe, the Wiſedome of <hi>God</hi> is ſuch, as hath no defect or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becillitie therein. But if it were not infinite both in action and in exiſtence, a man might finde defect therein, and imagine a more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wiſdome then that is, but this is impoſſible. So might I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude of all the other dignities of <hi>God.</hi> But I haſte to the purpoſe, and I thinke that you will not unwillingly grant what I have ſaid, but underſtand the reſt. All the Dignities of <hi>God</hi> being actuated or brought into working, require of neceſſitie an Infinite Object, whereon they work, becauſe they themſelues are infinite: but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be Infinite, but <hi>God</hi> alone; therefore it followeth that theſe Dignities are objected, or exerciſed in <hi>God</hi> alone. And this is that Eternall Sonne, begotten before the worlds, in whom the <hi>Father reſteth:</hi> or as the Prophet ſpeaketh, <hi>His beloved, in whom His ſoule delighteth;</hi> which cannot be applyed to any creature, without which, <hi>God</hi> is happy in Himſelfe: Therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, that <hi>in Him dwelleth the Godhead bodily.</hi> How is that? Not in His man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly body eternally; for His humane body tooke beginning of the fleſh of the Virgin, when the fulneſſe of time came, but yet bodily, that is, as eſſentially, or ſubſtantially, as the body of a man is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall to the man. For every dignitie of <hi>God</hi> being infinite in action (as was proved) muſt of neceſſitie produce ſuch as it ſelfe is. As for example; the Wiſedome of <hi>God,</hi> or His Infinite Vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, muſt have an Infinite intelligible, or underſtandable object, which is produced thereby, by an infinite underſtanding. So that ye muſt know of neceſſitie, and marke three Termes, as I will a while call them: the Terme from whence: the Terme whereto, or wherein: and the middle Terme betweene them. I will for your capacitie, which I know not to be much exerciſed in theſe mati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, make a compariſon meet for your underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>When the minde or underſtanding of a man conceiveth any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandable object, there is (you know) firſt the power of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in the mind it ſelfe; ſecondly the object underſtood; and thirdly, the diſcourſe or action of the underſtanding, whereby that object is apprehended.</p>
                  <p>Now give me leave to tell you, what differences you muſt make,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:107656:223"/>betweene the underſtanding of <hi>God,</hi> and the underſtanding of man in this compariſon.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the minde of man being finite, the underſtanding is notable to view all that, which can be underſtood thereby at one time, or with one action of underſtanding; but muſt conceive of one thing after another: whereas the Vnderſtanding and Wiſedome of <hi>God</hi> is ſuch, as at one ſight ſeeth himſelfe, and every thing elſe, paſt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and to come; and this not once onely, but even continually, becauſe it is eternally infinite.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the intendment of man worketh nothing in the thing conceived, to make it either to bee, if it be a meere conceit; or to be other then it is, if it be exiſtent: but the underſtanding of <hi>God,</hi> is by reaſon of His power ſo active, as that it cauſeth that, wherein it is exerciſed, both to be, and that according to his manner of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, or underſtanding of it: which underſtanding is by His Infinitie ſo infinite, and by His Eternitie ſo continuall, as that of neceſſitie there muſt be a ſubſiſtence, or a Perſon, wherein it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, which muſt alſo be Infinite and Eternall. And this is that glorious <hi>Sonne</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> who is thus begotten or produced eternally, both before the world was, even as hee is now, and ſhall not ceaſe to be produced, after the world ſhall ceaſe, eternally.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee two of the termes ſpoken of: From whence, and Wherein: now you muſt know the middle terme betweene them. The terme Whence, is the Wiſedome intelligent, <hi>God the Father.</hi> The terme Wherein, is the Wiſedome intelligible, <hi>God the Sonne.</hi> The middle terme is, <hi>ipſum intelligere,</hi> which in my Compariſon I called, The <hi>diſcourſe it ſelfe,</hi> which alſo in this muſt needes be Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite. For an Infinite intelligible, cannot be conceived of an Infinite intelligent, but by an Infinite action of the underſtanding: and this is that <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> which as you may eaſily underſtand, muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie proceed from both the <hi>Father,</hi> and the <hi>Sonne,</hi> and be alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and eternall, and therefore <hi>God.</hi> Now becauſe they are all Infinite, and of Infinites eſſentially, there can bee but one: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are theſe three in <hi>Eſſence</hi> or <hi>Being,</hi> one, but in <hi>Subſiſtence,</hi> or cleare diſtinction of <hi>Perſons,</hi> three.</p>
                  <p>Vnderſtand my compariſon, which I made: I will yet cleare the matier further for your conceiving.</p>
                  <p>If you take in a mirrour, the light of the Sunne, and reflect it directly thereon againe, in the Sunne it is one, in the glaſſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and yet the reflection of the beames, is alſo a third, but for all this, there is but one nature and Word of light, which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends all three: ſo is it in this <hi>Tri-Vnitie</hi> of which I ſpeake. My leiſure ſerues me not to dilate theſe things, but I hope you are able to underſtand what I ſay, therefore I will proceede. It is ſaid, that Powers are knowne by their actions, and actions are limitted by their objects. I know the meaning of it, and it is not unfit in this place. But to my reaſon: The Power of <hi>God</hi> is infinite, and by His
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:107656:223"/>infinite Wiſedome He knoweth it to be infinite: but <hi>God</hi> could not know that His Power were infinite, unleſſe He were able there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to bring forth an infinite action; and every infinite action muſt of neceſſitie be exerciſed in an infinite ſubject. (For whatſoever is received, is received according to the capacitie of the receiver:) therefore there is an infinite ſubject, wherein the power of <hi>God</hi> is exerciſed: that is, the <hi>Sonne,</hi> of whom I ſpeake. And here againe, behold the <hi>Tri-Vnitie;</hi> an infinite <hi>power,</hi> the <hi>Father;</hi> an infinite <hi>action,</hi> the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt;</hi> an infinite <hi>ſubject,</hi> the <hi>glorious Sonne;</hi> all three one infinite <hi>Being.</hi> Returne to your compariſon.</p>
                  <p>As the underſtanding of man could no way know his owne po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, but by his actions, neither can there be any actions of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, where there is nothing to bee underſtood, no more is it poſſible to be in the Deitie. Now underſtand that, as I have reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the <hi>Wiſedome</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> ſo might I reaſon from all His other Dignities: ſo that for one reaſon which I have brought, I might have brought you fiftie. But I ſhew you the way, if you be guided by the <hi>Spirit of Truth,</hi> how you may ſtrengthen your ſelfe in the way of Truth: therefore I will goe on, and ſhew you yet more plainely by more familiar reaſons.</p>
                  <p>An infinite power is not more weake then a finite: but every fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite creature, which we can caſt our eyes unto, doth by nature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce his like, as much as in it is; as a man begetteth a man; trees bring forth ſeed, whereof their like in nature may ſpring, and in like wiſe every other thing. Therefore the infinite Power of <hi>God</hi> begetteth His like alſo, which is the <hi>Sonne, the image of the inviſible God, the firſt begotten of every creature, Col.</hi> 1.15. But none can be like unto <hi>God</hi> in His Being, who is not very <hi>God:</hi> therefore <hi>Christ the onely begotten of the Father,</hi> is alſo very <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Maruail not, that I make this argument from the creature, to the Creator; for in this very point of the <hi>Power and Godhead,</hi> the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> Himſelfe teacheth me to reaſon of <hi>the inviſible things of God, by the things viſible, Rom.</hi> 1.20. And hereby alſo learne to help your ignorance, and put away your wonder, how <hi>God</hi> ſhould be one, and yet three. See you not how the underſtanding; the Sun-light alſo, is one in nature, and yet three in evident and cleare diſtinction? though in ſo baſe and imperfect order, as that which is in all perfection, is poſſible to be above it.</p>
                  <p>And further, ſee you not in every thing a bodie, a ſpirit, and a life, which is the knot betweene them?</p>
                  <p>Or rather, ſee you not how the very bodily compoſition is both one, and three? one body, which is united of three bodies? that is, earth, water, and ayre, or oyle, which yet againe in the roote of their nature are but one. For oyle is but a due mixture of water and earth, meanely fixt, and meanely volatil; and earth is but fixed water; ſo that water, which is but one, is the roote of the three: as it is manifeſt, <hi>Gene.</hi> 1. and 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.5. They which underſtand the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:107656:224"/>rules of Pyronomie, know what I ſay; and if you underſtood mee well, you would confeſſe, that not onely this inſtance which I have brought, of earth, water, and ayre; but even the whole frame of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture did proclaime the <hi>Trinitie</hi> in the <hi>Vnitie.</hi> If I ſhould here tell you, how the <hi>Heaven,</hi> the <hi>Earth,</hi> and the <hi>Deepe, Gene.</hi> 1. might bee underſtood myſtically, and the Analogie betweene the <hi>Creator</hi> and the <hi>creature</hi> therein: and then tell you, what <hi>Let the earth bring forth living ſoule,</hi> might meane, and compare it with that place, <hi>That which was made in Him was life;</hi> and then particularly for man, <hi>The Lord God alſo made the man of the duſt of the earth,</hi> and tell you, that it was ſo neceſſary, becauſe that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>Terra viventium:</hi> and inforce an argument to prove the <hi>Tri-Vnitie,</hi> by that treeble repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>man made in the image of God;</hi> comparing it with that place, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. and 7. If I ſhould then tell you, that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that the <hi>Sonne of God</hi> muſt become fleſh, as well that the <hi>infinite iuſtice of God</hi> might be actuated in Him, which could not be actuated in Him, being onely <hi>God:</hi> as for many other reaſons, Both from the Iuſtice, and Mercie, and Wiſedome of <hi>God,</hi> though to a well-ſighted underſtanding, I might ſeeme to have laid a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious foundation of Philoſophie, divine, and naturall: yet to you I might rather ſeeme perhaps to have propoſed Cabaliſticall dreames, then any ſound argument to the thing in queſtion.</p>
                  <p>Yet this will I tell you, and hold it for good Divinity: that the mayne drift and ſcope of the whole Scripture, is to ſhew the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all things in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> through Him, and for Him: and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring of the whole creature in man <hi>by Him: That in all things He might have the preeminence, Coloſs.</hi> 1. Neither doth this any whit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from the honour of the Father.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, <hi>It hath pleaſed the Father, that in Him ſhould all fulneſſe dwell:</hi> and beſides, it is an honour above all honours unto the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> to be the <hi>Father</hi> of ſo glorious a <hi>Sonne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore is this world, and all the things therein, created to the Image of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to expreſſe His glory, <hi>even as He is the expreſſed Image and glory of the Father.</hi> And here is the worlds Eternity, which had in <hi>Chriſt</hi> an eternall Being; according to that His Name, <hi>Eſay</hi> 9.6. <hi>The Father of Eternity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here are thoſe ſeparate Ideas, about which <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> could never agree, and which neither both of them, nor many of their followers did perfectly underſtand: not that they might not by the frame of nature, and the wiſedome which <hi>God</hi> had given to man, be underſtood.</p>
                  <p>For is not this world as a booke wherein we may read and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by the created truths, what is the <hi>Truth,</hi> which is increated? but all true knowledge is the gift of <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore wreſt not that place, <hi>Coloſs.</hi> 2.8. againſt the Chriſtian ſearch after the knowledge of nature, whereby above all other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane knowledges a man is brought to know <hi>God,</hi> and to honour
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:107656:224"/>Him as he ought: but rather be ſorry, that your knowledge of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is no more. For this will I tell you, to teach you to know your ſelfe, that there is nothing in the creature, which may be knowne, (and all may be knowne that is in the creature) but man ought to know it, and to glorifie the <hi>Creator</hi> thereby. <hi>And this great labour hath God given to men,</hi> that knowing how ſhort they are of that they ought to be, <hi>they might be humbled thereby, Pſal.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 1.13. And why ought this to ſeeme ſtrange? doth not <hi>God</hi> require that perfection at mans hand, wherein He did create Him? and was he not created with perfect diſcourſe to know the creature, that he might therein behold the <hi>Creator,</hi> and ſo glorifie His wondrous <hi>power</hi> and <hi>goodneſſe?</hi> But this queſtion would draw me from the queſtion in hand: and therfore I will briefly adde one reaſon more: and becauſe my leiſure is little, I will be as ſhort as I can: but I pray you lend me your eare; for it is hard in Engliſh, an inartifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all language, to expreſſe my mind: but becauſe you told me, you could a little Latine, I will be bold here and there, to uſe a word: my reaſon is thus. The whole and perfect nature of a Principle or Beginning is in <hi>God,</hi> who is alone the beginner of all things. Now a Principle is of three ſorts, whereof every one is ſo clearely diſtinct from another, as that one cannot poſſibly be that other: therefore in the <hi>Vnitie</hi> of the <hi>Deitie</hi> there is alſo ſuch cleare diſtinction into a <hi>Trinitie,</hi> as that one diſtinct cannot poſſible be that other, from which He is diſtinguiſhed; yet in the <hi>Vnitie</hi> of eſſence they are all one. The differences of a beginning ſtand thus; It is either <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipium principians, non principiatum;</hi> that is, a Beginning, which is a Beginner unto another; yet hath not His beginning from another, leſt there ſhould be a proceſſe into Infinitie <hi>à parte ante:</hi> this is <hi>God the Father,</hi> to whom it is peculiar to beget the <hi>Son,</hi> yet is Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe neither made, nor created, nor begotten of any other.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is <hi>Principium principiatum principians;</hi> to wit, a Beginning which hath his beginning of another, and is alſo a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to another, leſt there ſhould be any defect or imbecillitie in the Beginning: and this is the <hi>Everlaſting Sonne,</hi> very <hi>God</hi> of very <hi>God,</hi> begotten of the ſubſtance of His <hi>Father</hi> alone before the worlds, neither made, nor created.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly there is <hi>Principium principiatum non principians;</hi> that is, a Beginning, which is alſo begun, but is not a beginner unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: leſt there ſhould be a proceſſe into Infinitie <hi>à parte pòſt:</hi> and this is the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> who proceedeth from the very ſubſtance and Being of the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Sonne,</hi> and is with them one GOD coëternall and coëquall. But you will ſay, Is not the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> a Beginner unto any other? how is He then the Authour of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation? and how is He ſaid to <hi>lead us into all truth, &amp;c?</hi> Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what I meane: He is not a beginner unto any other of the ſame Infinite Eſſence or Being with Himſelfe. For the beginnings, which I ſpake of before, are in the Eſſence of <hi>God</hi> alone. Now our
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:107656:225"/>ſpirituall conſolation, whereof the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> is ſaid to be the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginner, is but an emanation or effluence from that Being, which he himſelfe is; as the light of the Sun doth illuminate every bright body expoſed to His light, and yet imparteth not His being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. You will againe object, that Eternitie hath no beginning, nor ending: how then can <hi>Chriſt</hi> be both eternall, and begun? and how againe can He be equall to the <hi>Father,</hi> whereas He being begotten of the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> hath a prioritie before Him? I anſwere, that this beginning is that production or begetting, which I before declared, to have beene heretofore no other, then it is now, and ſhall be eternally: as the Sun hath brought forth light ſince His creation, and ſhall ſtill bring forth light till the worlds diſſolution. For this action of <hi>God,</hi> whereby He begetteth His <hi>Sonne,</hi> is not a tranſient action, to cauſe a paſſion in the ſubject, and a repaſſion in the agent, for in ſuch, the ſubject of neceſſitie ſhould have beene exiſtent before the action; but this action is immanent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of neceſſitie of the ſame nature with the ſame agent; which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent becauſe it is eternall, therefore the production is alſo eternall, and conſequently the product, and ſo of neceſſitie very <hi>God.</hi> But you muſt ever remember what difference I made between the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>God</hi> infinite in power, and therefore able to actuate the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and the immanent actions of our minde. Now for the Prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, or Poſterioritie, you may object. I grant there is Prioritie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Perſons of the <hi>Godhead;</hi> but of what kind? not of Being; for their Eſſence is one, &amp; therein is none afore or after another, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is any one of the <hi>Trinitie</hi> more or leſſe God then another: not of time; for they are all one Eternitie: not of dignitie, for they are all one Infinitie, and the <hi>Sonne</hi> Himſelfe <hi>being very God, thinketh it no robberie to be equall with God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But yet there is Prioritie, and that of order onely; for the <hi>Father</hi> is in order before the <hi>Sonne,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Sonne</hi> is begotten of the <hi>Father:</hi> and the <hi>Sonne</hi> likewiſe is before the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> is the mutuall love betweene the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Sonne:</hi> and ſo proceeding from them both.</p>
                  <p>I will make a compariſon unmeet for the matier of which I ſpeak; for to whom ſhall wee liken the <hi>Higheſt?</hi> but yet meete to helpe your underſtanding. When a man doth dreame, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine things which are not, there is, you know, the phantaſie the phantaſme, or thing imagined or dreamed, and the phanſying or working of the phantaſie about that object. Now theſe three are all of one nature, and are one after another onely in order, and not in time.</p>
                  <p>For the particular phantaſie of ſuch an object, is before the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and makes it to have an intentionall being; then the object being the diſcourſe of the phantaſie, followeth in order, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe was in time as ſoone as it, obſeruing ever the cautions that are to be obſerued.</p>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:107656:225"/>
                  <p>Thus have I very briefly ſhowen not many reaſons, but rather how many reaſons may be ſhowen for this Chriſtian aſſertion: yet have I ſhowen ynough to perſwade any reaſonable man, to yeeld meekely unto the truth of that doctrine, which is ſo evident, both in the Booke of <hi>God,</hi> and in every faithfull and true Chriſtian mans confeſſion, and according to that diſcourſe, which is evident to every mans underſtanding. Now give me leave to ſpeake a little to thoſe arguments which have throwen the moſt learned of the <hi>Iewes</hi> headlong to the feete of <hi>Christ,</hi> to make them acknowledge that the <hi>Meſsiah muſt be both God and man.</hi> I will not herein doe any thing contrary to that, which in the beginning I proteſted, that is, not to compell you by authoritie of Scripture, but to intreat you by reaſonable perſwaſion, to encline your eare to the truth. But becauſe I may not without injury to the cauſe, leave altogether out ſuch manifeſt proofe, and without injurie alſo to your ſelfe, who might thinke that I went about to ſophiſticate a true ſeeming untruth, which would not abide the touch: I will onely intend my finger to ſome very few, of many thouſands of axioms of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for this purpoſe, and leave you to make the concluſion by your ſelfe, hoping that the <hi>Iewes</hi> example may provoke you to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them, ſo far forth as they have followed the truth. <hi>Exo.</hi> 13.21. it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord went before them, &amp;c.

                  <p>For in the firſt place it imports that Eternall and Infinite <hi>Being</hi> of the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> which they had before the worlds in their endleſſe glory and felicity, in that ſilence of the <hi>Deitie,</hi> in that ſuper-ſupreame Entity, which is unto the <hi>Godhead,</hi> perfect above perfection, without any reſpect unto the creature. It imports that Infinity, that Eternity, that Power, that Wiſedome, which is above all things, and gives unto it ſelfe, to be ſuch as it is: that <hi>Nothing</hi> (as the divine Areopagite ſeemes to ſpeake) which is before and aboue all things, that may be ſpoken or thought, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſpect of any emanation, or effluence whatſoever.

                     </gap>. Now in the ſecond place, it ſignifies the <hi>Deitie,</hi> as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in the creature: and therefore followes that Epithete <hi>Elohim</hi> which ſhewes that emanation of Power or Strength; and is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times given unto the creatures, Angels, and men.

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:107656:228"/>the other great myſteries, which this one letter doth import: the myſterie of the triple world; the myſterie of mercy and of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, of Election, and Reprobation; of that great <hi>Iubile,</hi> or <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of Sabbaths,</hi> when that which is above, ſhall againe deſcend to reſtore the creature from corruption and change, into that nimietie or exceſſe of Goodnes, wherein it was created. But theſe things are therfore here to be omitted, becauſe the diſcourſe therof were long, and becauſe they are rather conſequents, then premiſes to the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. To tell you at once, and to make an end of this argument: The whole Nation of the learned <hi>Iewes</hi> confeſſe, that the <hi>Meſsiah</hi> ſhould be called by this great Name: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. To which purpoſe, there are, beſides theſe which have beene brought, many places of Scripture, which in the <hi>Hebrue</hi> veritie are moſt direct, though by our tranſlations they might ſeeme ſomewhat harſh. They hold, I ſay, that He muſt be both <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man:</hi> and in a word, there is nothing, which wee Chriſtians doe affirme concerning our <hi>Lord,</hi> but the evidence of Scripture doth compell them to confeſſe it. Onely they differ in this, from us; whether <hi>This Ieſus be that Chriſt, that ſhould come into the world;</hi> though this alſo be a thing not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable, as you may learne of <hi>Daniel</hi> 9. <hi>verſ.</hi> 24, 25, 26. and 2. <hi>Eſd.</hi> 7. <hi>verſe</hi> 28.29.</p>
                  <p>Although the common error and expectation of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> was of a terreſtriall Monarchie; yet the beſt learned of them agree, that <hi>the Kingdome of Chriſt is not of this world.</hi> For they remember that place in the Teſtament of <hi>Iacob: The Scepter ſhall not depart from Iuda, till Shiloh come.</hi> By which it followes, that when <hi>Meſsiah</hi> ſhall come, there ſhould be no more ſhew of an earthly kingdome. That of <hi>Zach.</hi> 9.9. is as direct, <hi>Ieruſalem, behold, thy King commeth unto thee poore.</hi> They remeber alſo that in the 21. <hi>Pſ. I am a worme and noman, a ſhame of men and the contempt of the people.</hi> And that alſo of <hi>Eſay</hi> 53. <hi>He hath neither forme nor beauty; when we ſee Him, there ſhall be no forme that we ſhould deſire Him, He is deſpiſed and rejected of men, &amp;c.</hi> Reade the whole Chapter and the Pſalme, compare them with the hiſtories of His Paſsion, and behold <hi>Him</hi> on the Croſſe, in the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of His anguiſh, and extreame perplexity.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, what is this Iudaiſme in the letters of His Name, for argument to prove that He is <hi>God?</hi> Is it more, then if we ſhould write the Name of <hi>Chriſt</hi> with the laſt letter thereof capital, <hi>ChrisT;</hi> becauſe it may repreſent the Croſſe? or elſe the two laſt letters ſo interlaced, that they may have reference to the Serpent in the wilderneſſe, becauſe that was alſo a figure of CHRIST? Though I had here to anſwere for the Cabala of every of the 72. languages of the Confuſion, yet I ſay onely thus: If after all this that I have ſaid, you will ſtill be contentious; I have no ſuch cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, but I am well content, that either thus, or by any other meanes, a ChrisTian man ſhould hold that in perpetuall memory,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:107656:229"/>which is his Ioy, his Victory, his Crowne, his happineſſe in this world, and in the world to come.</p>
                  <p>Were it to any purpoſe to make you know, what the ancient Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, who knew not the Scriptures, have thought of this mati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? all ſpeaking this one thing which the light that <hi>God</hi> hath given to mankind, did make them know, although they concealed their intendement by divers names. Yet <hi>Hermes</hi> called Him plainely the <hi>Sonne</hi> of <hi>God. Zoroaſter,</hi> the <hi>Vnderſtanding of His Father. Pythagoras, Wiſedome;</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> every where, and particularly, <hi>Prou.</hi> 8. and in the booke of that title.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Parmenides</hi> named him <hi>The Sphere of Vnderſtanding. Orpheus</hi> ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him <hi>Pallas,</hi> to the ſame effect as the other, if you know the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: and yet hee ſpeakes more plainely to the <hi>Trinitie,</hi> in his Hymnes of <hi>the Night,</hi> of <hi>the Heaven,</hi> and of <hi>the Ayre. Platoes ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Idea's</hi> meane nothing elſe: and in ſumme, as many of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, as were worth any thing, were not ignorant of this thing. But I feare, theſe authorities are with you of little worth: yet have I brought them, that you may ſee how wee are furniſhed with all kind of proofes, and how you do contemne all maner of teſtimony.</p>
                  <p>If this which I have ſaid, perſwade you to look better to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of your faith it is ſufficient: if it perſwade you nothing, then have I done contrary to the Commandement, which forbiddeth to caſt pearles before ſwine. But yet I hope, that <hi>God</hi> will not ſuffer you to be led any longer by that <hi>ſpirit of Antichriſt,</hi> againſt which S. <hi>Iohn</hi> doth ſo often warne us. For I doe you to wit, that this your hereſie is no new thing, but even as ancient as the Apoſtles time. For, the reaſon of <hi>Iohns</hi> writing of his Goſpel, was, to prove the <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> againſt the Hereticks that denied it in His own time. And truely, I maruell that you, who have received this hereſie from the rotten bones of <hi>Arius,</hi> ſhould not provide for your ſafety as he did. He denied the authority of S. <hi>Iohns</hi> writings to be authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call. And why? becauſe this earth-bred Giant, which would pull <hi>Chriſt</hi> out of the throne of His <hi>Deitie,</hi> ſhould with his lightning be ſuddenly burnt. Beleeve you the Scripture? Is <hi>Iohns</hi> authority ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient? then the caſe is plaine. <hi>We are in Him that is true, in His Son Ieſus Chriſt, who is very God, and eternall life.</hi> 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.20. Can you now confer this Scripture with that place, <hi>I have ſaid yee are Gods,</hi> and not be aſhamed? <hi>I and the Father are one.</hi> The <hi>Iewes</hi> underſtood that He herein profeſſed Himſelfe to be very <hi>God:</hi> and are you His enemy more then they? Reade <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. <hi>ver.</hi> 30. &amp; 33. &amp; 34. and you may underſtand the meaning of both places. The devills acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Him to be <hi>God</hi> of Infinite power: <hi>I know Thee who Thou art, even that Holy One of God:</hi> And will not you confeſſe as much as the devills? But this is more then I thought to ſay, onely you may ſee hereby, that we ſpeake no other thing then <hi>Chriſt</hi> Himſelfe, even in His enemies underſtanding, ſaid. Now if you could ſee a little the folly of your own opinion; that were inough to cauſe you to put on
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:107656:229"/>a better mind. I will touch it as lightening doth touch the ground: for if you be willing to be reformed, there is no doubt, but you may propound it to the learned Divines, and be fully ſatisfied. You ſay <hi>Chriſt is onely man, but yet indued with the infinite Power of God.</hi> Here firſt you doe injurie to the <hi>Higheſt,</hi> to make the <hi>Power of God</hi> to be accidentall unto Him: whereas hee is <hi>purus actus,</hi> abſolute perfection, and without ſhadow of change: His Being is moſt ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and pure, not capeable of accidents. Then His Being is ſuch, as no addition can be made thereto, to make it more then it is: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is neceſſary, that He be ever actually whatſoever he may be. Beſides, His Being is Infinitely diſtant from Not-Being; therefore His Power is inſeparable. Againe, if there come any thing to <hi>God</hi> as an accident, it muſt come unto Him from Himſelfe; or elſe from another: not from another, for He is impaſſible, or ſuch as ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer violence: not from Himſelfe; for all ſuch accidents doe proceed <hi>à potentiâ,</hi> that is, from the imbecillity, or imperfection of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: but His <hi>Being</hi> is moſt ſimple, and infinitely perfect. Againe, all accidents do riſe from the matier, forme or compoſition of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. In Him is neither matier, forme, nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poſition. Now al things we ſee in this world, do conſiſt, <hi>ex actu &amp; potentiâ,</hi> of perfection from <hi>God,</hi> &amp; imperfection from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues: for of themſelues they are <hi>non entia,</hi> abſolutely nothing. Yea, even the very Angels, and the ſoule it ſelfe, are partakers of this compoſition: (for nothing is <hi>purus actus,</hi> but <hi>God</hi> alone) therefore are they ſubject to accidents; yet they which come neereſt to perfection, are moſt free from acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents; as that which is meere perfection, hath no accidents at all. Know then, that all the dignities of <hi>God</hi> are in him eſſentially one <hi>God.</hi> For the <hi>Goodneſſe</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> His <hi>Power,</hi> His <hi>Wiſedome,</hi> His <hi>Glory, &amp;c.</hi> Being all <hi>infinite,</hi> do of neceſſitie concurre in the nature of <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</hi> Whence it followeth, that whatſoever is in Him, is eſſentially Himſelfe: therefore the power of <hi>God</hi> is not accidental, or ſuch as may be imparted to a man. The learned <hi>Hebrues</hi> according to this doe hold, that <hi>Enſoph</hi> or <hi>Infinitie,</hi> is not to be numbred among the other <hi>attributes of God:</hi> becauſe it is that abſtract Vnity, whereinto they all eſſentially concurre, and from which they all eſſentially proceed. and hence by the way take another ſtrong argument to the former queſtion: for if <hi>God</hi> bee eſſentially a <hi>Father,</hi> then the terme correlative, a <hi>Sonne,</hi> muſt be in the <hi>Godhead</hi> alſo, and that eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially. But now againe ſee another folly in your ſuppoſition. The work of our Redemption is a work of infinite goodneſſe, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, power, wiſedome and glory; therefore it followeth, that <hi>Chriſt.</hi> the worker, had infinite mercie, power, wiſedome, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now I demand; had <hi>Chriſt</hi> this infinite <hi>goodneſſe</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> ſo given to Him of <hi>God,</hi> that the <hi>Father</hi> Himſelfe had in the meane time none? This you dare not ſay, for that were to ſay, that <hi>God</hi> did ceaſe to be <hi>God:</hi> which cannot ſtand with His Eternity.</p>
                  <p>Now if <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> had, notwithſtanding this abſolute infinite power of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of which he ſpake, <hi>All power is given unto Me, both in
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:107656:230"/>heaven and in earth:</hi> then it followeth that either there were two infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of power; or elſe that theſe two which had this infinite <hi>Power,</hi> were all one Infinite. The firſt is againſt the nature of Infinitie for that is abſolutely infinite, which ſo comprehendeth all things, as that it leaveth nothing without it ſelfe, and yet is not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended to any other. Beſides, if you would ſay, that the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Sonne</hi> had each of them ſeverall indiuiſible infinite Powers; it muſt follow, that neither of their <hi>Powers</hi> were abſolutely infinite: becauſe each of them had not the infinite <hi>Power</hi> of the other: And beſides, that both theſe infinite <hi>Powers</hi> muſt be conjoyned with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite <hi>weakenes,</hi> becauſe they muſt be mutually ſubjected to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite <hi>Power</hi> one of the other. But both theſe things are impoſſible. So you ſee that two Infinities can by no meanes ſtand together: therefore it followeth, that theſe two, to wit, the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> are in <hi>Being</hi> one, and that of infinite <hi>Power;</hi> and this is that which I ſtrive for: which, as you ſee, I have concluded by your own aſſertion.</p>
                  <p>The time would faile me, to lay before your eyes the manifold untruths, which would enſue of your poſition, which ſavoureth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of wit, judgement, nor learning: And therefore I ſee, how they which have once departed from the truth, muſt of neceſſrity run into infinite abſurdities. Therefore looke back, and be aſhamed of ſuch new-fangled toys, as you do daily imagine, which in truth do argue the great inconſtancy and vanity of your mind, &amp; withall, ſuch pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable blindnes of underſtanding, as the darknes of <hi>Egypt.</hi> For tel me without ſelfe-liking, what ſound judgement doth this argue, to be driven about with every wind of doctrine? a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> a <hi>Browniſt,</hi> an <hi>Anabaptiſt,</hi> an <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> What bringing up? what gift of learning and knowledge have you, that you ſhould preſume to oppoſe your ſentence, againſt the faith &amp; doctrine of all the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Churches in the world? Bluſh, and <hi>learne with meeknes the truth of that Word, which is able to ſave your ſoule.</hi> You may ſee by your owne miſerable experience, what it is to forſake the Vnitie of Faith, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Saints, who imbrace the truth of <hi>Gods</hi> word, and have manifeſt <hi>tokens that they are the true Church,</hi> to wit, <hi>The word of</hi> God <hi>truely taught, and the Sacraments duely adminiſtred.</hi> What if there want perfection? The Church militant muſt ever confeſſe; <hi>I am lovely, yet black:</hi> For it is impoſſible that any church ſhould be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out imperfection, ſo long as the world ſtandeth: but at the end <hi>it ſhall be preſented without ſpot or wrinkle.</hi> Therefore <hi>remember from whence you are fallen, and repent, and doe the works of righteouſneſſe, leſt Chriſt,</hi> whom you ſo deſpite, <hi>come againſt you ſhortly.</hi> The worke of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is not in fooliſh queſtions, and diſputing about needles ſubtilties, but in doing the works of truth and righteouſneſſe. Pray, and endeavour your ſelfe thereto. And till ſuch time as <hi>God</hi> for His <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſake, vouchſafe to have mercy on you, the enemy of His <hi>Son,</hi> and give you grace to repent of this great wickednes, I am neither your friend nor yet your foe.</p>
